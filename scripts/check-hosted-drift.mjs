 *
 * DRIFT GUARD for the hosted (mcp.novada.com) tool surface.
 *
 * UPDATED 2026-07-20 (Option A — core-derivation refactor): hosted-server/vercel/api/mcp.ts
 * no longer hand-curates its `TOOLS` array. It now builds it as
 *   `const TOOLS = CORE_TOOLS.map((t) => ({ ... }))`
 * where `CORE_TOOLS` is imported straight from npm-package's `core.ts` (`TOOLS as
 * CORE_TOOLS`) — the SAME single source of truth the npm stdio server and every test
 * import. This makes silent tool drift on the *listing* structurally much harder than
 * the old hand-curated-array world this script was originally written for: there is no
 * longer a parallel, independently-typed 15-tool literal that could quietly diverge from
 * core's real registry. What CAN still drift, and what this script now guards:
 *
 *   (1) DERIVATION REGRESSION — someone reverts `const TOOLS = CORE_TOOLS.map(...)` back
 *       to a hand-written literal array (or removes the `TOOLS as CORE_TOOLS` import),
 *       silently reintroducing the exact duplication this refactor eliminated.
 *   (2) HOSTED_HIDDEN drift — mcp.ts's `HOSTED_HIDDEN` exclusion set (the ONLY thing that
 *       keeps a core tool OFF the hosted listing now) silently gains or loses an entry
 *       without config/surfaces.json's "hosted" manifest being updated in the same
 *       reviewed diff — i.e. the manifest stops accurately documenting what's excluded
 *       and why.
 *   (3) Ghost/renamed exclusions — HOSTED_HIDDEN (or the manifest's mirror of it) names a
 *       tool that isn't even in npm-package's registry (typo, or the tool was renamed/
 *       removed and the exclusion entry was never cleaned up).
 *   (4) Regression on the PINNED "hosted-15" eval fixture — the original 15 tools the
 *       Layer-5 eval harness (npm-package/eval/model-eval-runner.mjs --surface=hosted-15)
 *       assumes are always reachable on hosted must remain a SUBSET of whatever the live
 *       "hosted" surface derives to. If a future HOSTED_HIDDEN edit accidentally excluded
 *       one of those 15 (e.g. novada_search), the eval fixture's core assumption would be
 *       silently false.
 *   (5) The LIVE RUNTIME FILTER regressing — (1)-(4) above only ever compare CATALOG-level
 *       name sets (TOOLS, HOSTED_HIDDEN, surfaces.json). None of them prove the actual
 *       ListTools/discover code path (`visibleTools` in buildServer(), which applies
 *       `.filter(t => !HOSTED_HIDDEN.has(t.name))`) still excludes HOSTED_HIDDEN
 *       tools from what's served. Deleting that one clause would serve every HOSTED_HIDDEN
 *       tool to every hosted caller while (1)-(4) kept reporting PASS.
 *       UPDATED 2026-07-20 (B2 fix, novada-test-engineering synthesis.md tools-v2 audit):
 *       this clause used to read `.filter(t => !isHosted || !HOSTED_HIDDEN.has(t.name))` —
 *       fail-OPEN, because `isHosted` (a VERCEL/VERCEL_ENV env-var sniff) is not guaranteed
 *       to be set, and when falsy the predicate short-circuited to `true` for every tool,
 *       serving every HOSTED_HIDDEN tool by default. The fix removed the `isHosted` gate
 *       entirely (this file IS the hosted server; HOSTED_HIDDEN must always apply) — this
 *       script's own pattern below was updated to match, since it previously encoded the
 *       BUGGY fail-open clause as the "expected" (PASS) shape.
 *   (6) A dynamic bypass mutating `TOOLS`/`visibleTools` AFTER their declarations
 *       (`.push`/`.splice`/`.concat`/`.unshift`, `...TOOLS` spreads, `Object.assign(TOOLS, ...)`,
 *       length-based truncate/append) — the pre-refactor version of this script had a
 *       mutation gate that caught exactly this shape (2026-07-18 red-team finding); the
 *       2026-07-20 core-derivation rewrite dropped it.
 *
 * Five gates, run in this order (see main()):
 *   (derivation gate) mcp.ts is scanned for the two structural markers that prove TOOLS is
 *       still derived from core (the `TOOLS as CORE_TOOLS` import AND the
 *       `const TOOLS = CORE_TOOLS.map(` construction). Either marker missing = hard fail
 *       — this script refuses to trust anything else it parses out of mcp.ts once the
 *       derivation itself can't be confirmed (mirrors the pre-refactor mutation-gate's
 *       "don't report false PASS against an unverifiable state" philosophy).
 *   (runtime-filter gate) the LIVE `.filter(t => !HOSTED_HIDDEN.has(t.name))`
 *       clause that builds `visibleTools` (what ListTools/discover actually serve) must be
 *       present in mcp.ts, UNCONDITIONALLY (no `isHosted` bypass) — see (5) above.
 *   (mutation gate) mcp.ts is scanned, AFTER `TOOLS`'s declaration, for any dynamic mutation
 *       of TOOLS or visibleTools — see (6) above.
 *   (a) every tool name in config/surfaces.json's "hosted" AND "hosted-15" surfaces is a
 *       member of npm-package's REGISTERED_TOOL_NAMES (npm-package/src/tools/registry.ts)
 *       — no ghost/renamed tool reaches the hosted endpoint or the eval fixture.
 *   (b) the LIVE mcp.ts HOSTED_HIDDEN set, read directly off disk right now, is an exact
 *       SET match against `REGISTERED_TOOL_NAMES \ surfaces.json["hosted"].tools` — i.e.
 *       the manifest's "hosted" list and mcp.ts's real exclusion set agree on exactly
 *       which tools are cut, so any future silent HOSTED_HIDDEN edit fails until
 *       surfaces.json is updated in the same reviewed diff.
 *   (c) surfaces.json's "hosted-15" tools are a SUBSET of "hosted" tools — the pinned eval
 *       fixture's tools must never fall out of what's actually live on hosted.
 *
 * ── Loading method: plain TEXT PARSING of mcp.ts, NOT import/execution. Why this is
 *    the stable choice (unchanged from the pre-refactor version of this script): ────────
 *
 *   - hosted-server/vercel/api/mcp.ts constructs a real MCP `Server`, runs Sentry.init(),
 *     imports @vercel/kv / @vercel/functions, strips process.env consumption creds as a
 *     MODULE-LOAD side effect, and pulls from hosted-server/vercel/vendor/ (generated by
 *     deploy-hosted.sh, never hand-edited — see repo CLAUDE.md). None of that is safe,
 *     meaningful, or even possible to `import` from a plain Node script without a
 *     Vercel-shaped environment (KV creds, Sentry DSN, etc.) — and mcp.ts is TypeScript,
 *     so plain `node` cannot execute it directly regardless.
 *   - npm-package/src/tools/registry.ts IS side-effect-free by its own docstring, but
 *     importing it as TS would need either a build step (npm-package/build/tools/
 *     registry.js — a compiled artifact that can go stale relative to src/ between
 *     builds) or a TS loader (ts-node/tsx) this repo does not wire up for one-off
 *     scripts. Depending on build freshness would make this "CI-runnable node script"
 *     secretly require `npm run build` first — a hidden precondition that itself could
 *     drift.
 *
 *   Both files are read as plain text; the `HOSTED_HIDDEN` / `TOOL_REGISTRY` array
 *   literals are sliced out with anchor strings unique to each file (verified against the
 *   current source before writing this script), then every `"novada_..."` string inside
 *   that slice is extracted with a regex. Each extraction is asserted non-empty so a
 *   broken anchor fails loudly instead of silently passing a vacuous check.
 *
 * ── THREAT MODEL — read this before trusting (or extending) this script ──────────────
 *
 * A round-2 red-team pass (2026-07-19, pre-refactor) proved that no amount of additional
 * regex-pattern-matching can make a text-based check complete against a determined
 * committer — text-pattern matching over a Turing-complete language is fundamentally an
 * incomplete defense. This script's honest, bounded job:
 *
 * CATCHES:
 *   - Accidental drift: mcp.ts's HOSTED_HIDDEN literal and config/surfaces.json's
 *     "hosted" list silently falling out of sync because ONE of the two was edited and
 *     the other forgotten.
 *   - Reverting the derivation itself: TOOLS going back to a hand-curated literal, or the
 *     `TOOLS as CORE_TOOLS` import disappearing.
 *   - A HOSTED_HIDDEN entry (or a surfaces.json "hosted"/"hosted-15" entry) that names a
 *     tool no longer in npm-package's registry.
 *   - The pinned "hosted-15" eval fixture silently falling out of what's live on hosted.
 *
 * DOES NOT DEFEND against a committer DELIBERATELY obfuscating a bypass inside an
 * otherwise-reviewed PR — e.g. a computed HOSTED_HIDDEN entry, an aliased mutation of the
 * same Set reference under a different local name, or a mutation performed from a
 * DIFFERENT file that imports and changes the served list at module-load time. That class
 * of attack is CODE REVIEW's responsibility, not a static script's — this script exists to
 * make the common, honest, or careless failure modes impossible to ship by accident, not
 * to prove every diff is safe.
 *
 * Usage:  node scripts/check-hosted-drift.mjs
 * Exit codes: 0 = no drift, 1 = drift detected or manifest/parse error.
