# Novada MCP — complete tool reference

Every tool Novada MCP exposes, grouped by category. The [README](../README.md) shows only the
handful you reach for most; this is the full list.

- **38 tools across 6 categories.** Self-host (`npx novada-mcp`) exposes all 38.
- The hosted default surface (`mcp.novada.com`) exposes **30** — the same registry minus 8 tools
  that don't apply to a stateless serverless endpoint: `novada_browser_flow` (needs a persistent
  browser session), `novada_site_copy` (writes files to disk), `novada_ip_whitelist` /
  `novada_static_ip_mgmt` / `novada_capture_apikey` (write-gated account ops), `novada_session_stats`
  / `novada_search_feedback` (per-process in-memory state), and `novada_verify` (currently omitted
  from the hosted `tools/list` listing). It's core-derived, not a hand-curated subset — every other
  tool below (including `novada_browser`, which is NOT the same tool as `novada_browser_flow`) runs
  on both surfaces.
- Not sure what's on your connection? Call **`novada_discover`** — it returns this catalog live,
  with each tool's name, category, and status.
- **Hosted?** column below: ✅ = available on `mcp.novada.com`, ❌ = local-only (`npx novada-mcp`).

## Search

| Tool | Best for | Returns | Hosted? |

| `novada_search_feedback` | Rating a prior `novada_search` result set to improve future ranking | Thank-you/echo confirmation | ❌ per-process in-memory state |

## Scrape

`novada_scrape` is the generic gateway (16 platforms, ~87 operations). The 15 `novada_scrape_<platform>`
tools wrap the same backend behind a **closed, typed `operation` enum** scoped to one platform, so an
agent can't call an invalid operation for the wrong platform. Every listed `operation` is
verified-working — operations we can't currently deliver are excluded, not left in to fail on you.
All 16 scrape tools run on both local and hosted.
