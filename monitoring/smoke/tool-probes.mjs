/**
 * monitoring/smoke/tool-probes.mjs
 *
 * Probe registry for the all-tools functional smoke suite (Layer B). Feeds
 * monitoring/smoke/all-tools-smoke.mjs, which owns the actual tiering logic
 * and execution. This file only holds probe DATA and pure classification
 * helpers — no network calls, no fs access.
 *
 * Three tiers (budget-aware by design):
 *
 *   Tier-1  ALWAYS executed — a handful of free/cheap read-only calls that
 *           prove the hosted endpoint's core surface is alive. Every run.
 *   Tier-2  ALWAYS checked, NEVER executed — presence-only. The actual tool
 *           list comes from a LIVE `tools/list` call in all-tools-smoke.mjs
 *           (single source of truth; nothing here hardcodes the 30/38+ tool
 *           names). This file only supplies the classification data Tier-2
 *           needs: which scraper platforms have a documented backend-side
 *           flakiness issue (TOW2-305), so a Tier-3 failure on one of them is
 *           never mistaken for a regression.
 *   Tier-3  OPTIONAL, gated by `SMOKE_SCRAPERS=1` (default OFF) — ONE real,
 *           credit-costing scraper call per run, rotated across a small
 *           SAFE (currently status:ok, non-flaky) sample so coverage spreads
 *           over time without paying for every platform on every run.
 *
 * READ-ONLY GUARANTEE: every probe/args pair below is a read operation.
 * Nothing in this file may ever describe a write-tool call — see
 * NEVER_EXECUTE_TOOL_NAMES, which all-tools-smoke.mjs checks defensively
 * before executing anything from Tier-1 or Tier-3.

// ─── Tier-1: free/cheap core probes, executed every run ─────────────────────

// onboarding/catalog calls, novada_account(section:"balance") is a read-only
// wallet check, novada_search/novada_extract are capped to the smallest
// possible unit of work (num:1, a static example.com page).

// ─── Tier-3: rotating small sample of KNOWN-GOOD (status:ok) scraper ops ────
// Only executed when SMOKE_SCRAPERS=1 (see pickTier3Sample below — exactly
// ONE entry runs per invocation). Each op/param pair is verified against its
// tool's own source at the time this file was written:
//   - novada_scrape_google:     npm-package/src/tools/scrape_google.ts       GOOGLE_OPERATIONS.web_search     -> "google_search"
//   - novada_scrape_duckduckgo: npm-package/src/tools/scrape_duckduckgo.ts   DUCKDUCKGO_OPERATIONS.web_search  -> "duckduckgo"
//   - novada_scrape_amazon:     npm-package/src/tools/scrape_amazon.ts       AMAZON_OPERATIONS.products_by_keywords -> "amazon_product_keywords"
//   - novada_scrape_walmart:    npm-package/src/tools/scrape_walmart.ts      WALMART_OPERATIONS.product_by_keyword  -> "walmart_product_keywords"
// None of these platforms are in BACKEND_KNOWN_FLAKY_PLATFORMS below — this
// sample is deliberately restricted to platforms NOT already flagged flaky,
// so a failure here is a real signal, not backend noise.
//
// V3-N1/C-2 follow-up (2026-09-03, CLASS-NOT-INSTANCE closure): Layer D
// (full-tools-probe.mjs) fixed the `records >= 1`-only PASS predicate for the
// SAME operations this Tier-3 sample exercises — see full-tools-probe.mjs's
// SUBSTANCE_TABLE doc comment for the full mechanism (a bare/schema-
// mismatched envelope, e.g. duckduckgo's `web_search` with no
// `organic_results` array, wraps as a single synthetic "record" and reads as
// `records: 1`). Tier-3 shares the exact same tool+operation
// (novada_scrape_duckduckgo/web_search) and was ALSO substance-blind
// (all-tools-smoke.mjs's runTier3() used a bare `res.ok` PASS predicate —
// see that file). `catalogOpId` below is the SAME key
// full-tools-probe.mjs's SUBSTANCE_TABLE uses, so runTier3() can call the
// SAME `checkScraperSubstance()` (imported, never forked) that Layer D uses.
// `format: "json"` is required for that function to parse real fields out of
// the response — same reasoning as full-tools-probe.mjs's PROBES entries.
