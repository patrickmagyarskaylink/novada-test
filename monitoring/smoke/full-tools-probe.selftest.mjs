/**
 * monitoring/smoke/full-tools-probe.selftest.mjs
 *
 * Dependency-free, OFFLINE self-test for full-tools-probe.mjs's pipeline.
 * Makes ZERO network calls and needs NO NOVADA_TEST_KEY — it injects a stub
 * callTool/listTools into full-tools-probe.mjs's exported `runAllProbes` and
 * asserts on the real classification pipeline (classifyFailure, the
 * processing→poll-AND-RESUME disambiguation, the write-guard, the
 * network-retry wrapper), not a re-implementation of it. The
 * processingPollIntervalMs dependency is zeroed out for this run (see the
 * runAllProbes call below) so the real ~10s-apart, up-to-4-attempt resume
 * loop (TOW2-257 Phase 4) still executes for real but completes in
 * milliseconds instead of tens of seconds.
 *
 * This exists because the CRITICAL bug found in code review (2026-07-24) —
 * an args-unaware write-guard throwing OUTSIDE any try/catch at probe #14,
 * FATAL-exiting the run with zero results for the remaining 16 scrapers —
 * would have been caught immediately by assertion (1) below. Run this after
 * ANY change to full-tools-probe.mjs:
 *
 *   node monitoring/smoke/full-tools-probe.selftest.mjs
 *
 * Assertions:
 *   1. Every probe in PROBES was attempted (results.length === PROBES.length)
 *      and every row has a well-formed {name, status, domain} shape — i.e.
 *      the run never silently drops tools or crashes partway through.
 *   2. preflightAssertAllProbesExecutable() does not throw for the real,
 *      committed PROBES list (confirms the args-aware carve-out for
 *      novada_proxy_account_create's no-confirm dry-run actually works).
 *   3. Fifteen scripted canned scenarios (a plain pass; an isolated backend
 *      520; processing→poll-completes-on-attempt-1; processing→resolves-only-
 *      on-attempt-3 (TOW2-257 Phase 4 fixture (a) — proves the resume LOOP
 *      actually iterates); processing→NEVER resolves, exhausts all 4 resume
 *      attempts on a non-flaky platform (fixture (b) — must be ASYNC, not a
 *      ③-backend FAIL); the SAME never-resolves case on a KNOWN-FLAKY
 *      platform (fixture (b) again — flakiness must not change the ASYNC
 *      outcome); processing→resumes to a genuine Failed outcome on attempt 2
 *      (fixture (c) — must be ③-backend FAIL, stopping immediately instead of
 *      waiting out the remaining attempts); processing-matched-but-no-
 *      task_id; a validation error we own; an INVALID_API_KEY auth error;
 *      httpStatus-0-then-retry-recovers; httpStatus-0-retry-exhausted; a
 *      scraper `50004: context deadline exceeded` backend timeout on a
 *      NON-flaky platform; a 2026-07-30 free-gateway-cap error on a CORE
 *      tool; the SAME free-gateway-cap error on a KNOWN-FLAKY platform) each
 *      classify to the EXACT status+domain+severity this script's
 *      2026-07-24/2026-07-28/2026-07-30/TOW2-257-Phase-4 review fixes
 *      specify. The `novada_scrape_google` scenario is the
 *      ratchet for the real-world mislabel found 2026-07-28:
 *      `scraper.novada.com/request` returning `{code:50004,
 *      msg:"context deadline exceeded"}` (a genuine BACKEND outage,
 *      reproduced with a raw curl, zero MCP involved) was, before the
 *      isBackendSignal fix, falling through every existing pattern (it is
 *      not a known-flaky platform, not a validation error, not an
 *      INVALID_API_KEY, not an HTTP 5xx/network failure, and did not match
 *      the old BACKEND_SIGNAL_RE's exact wording) all the way to step 8's
 *      ①-mcp-code fail-safe default — a false "our-code" P1 on every
 *      non-flaky platform during a pure backend outage. Confirmed by
 *      temporarily reverting the `isBackendSignal` check in classifyFailure
 *      and re-running this self-test: the scenario below classified
 *      `①-mcp-code`/P1 instead of `③-backend`/P2. The `novada_search` and
 *      `novada_scrape_yandex` scenarios are the ratchet for the 2026-07-30
 *      incident: before the FREE_CAP_RE fix, the CORE-tool case fell through
 *      to step 8's ①-mcp-code fail-safe (false "code bug" P0) and the
 *      known-flaky-platform case was swallowed by step 3's isFlaky branch
 *      (false ③-backend/P3) — both wrong, since a free-gateway-cap rejection
 *      is billing/test-infra, not a code bug or a backend outage.
 *   4. novada_proxy_account_create (no confirm) never crashes the run and
 *      classifies as a PASS/SLOW — the literal CRITICAL regression check.
 *   5. adviceFor() on the novada_search free-gateway-cap scenario returns
 *      advice text mentioning "free-gateway cap" (review round 1, 2026-07-30
 *      HIGH fix) — classifyFailure() alone is not enough; adviceFor()'s
 *      ②-gateway block must ALSO branch on the new note, or a cap-hit row's
 *      report advice silently falls through to the generic "check
 *      hosted-server Vercel function health..." fallthrough, which is the
 *      exact misdirection this whole fix targets.
 *
 * Exit code: non-zero on ANY assertion mismatch, or if the pipeline itself
 * throws uncaught (caught by the outer .catch() below and reported as FATAL
 * — that is ALSO a self-test failure, since the whole point is "the run
 * must never crash").
