 * monitoring/smoke/full-tools-probe.mjs
 *
 * Layer D of the synthetic monitor for the live Novada hosted MCP
 * (https://mcp.novada.com) — see monitoring/README.md. Unlike Layer B
 * (all-tools-smoke.mjs, cheap/free calls every 6h), this is the DAILY "test
 * every hosted tool for real" probe: one representative, safe, read-only (or
 * dry-run) call per tool, including every billable per-platform scraper.
 * Dependency-free Node >=20 script; run directly with `node`.
 *
 * A companion OFFLINE self-test lives at
 * monitoring/smoke/full-tools-probe.selftest.mjs — it imports this module's
 * exported pipeline (runAllProbes/classifyFailure/etc.), injects a stub
 * callTool/listTools (no network, no key needed), and asserts every canned
 * scenario classifies correctly. Run it after any change to this file:
 *   node monitoring/smoke/full-tools-probe.selftest.mjs
 *
 * Usage:
 *   NOVADA_TEST_KEY=<key> node monitoring/smoke/full-tools-probe.mjs
 *
 * Env vars:
 *   NOVADA_TEST_KEY  (required) test API key — NEVER hardcode, env only.
 *   MCP_URL          (optional) override the endpoint (see lib/mcp-client.mjs).
 *   SMOKE_SLOW_MS    (optional) threshold in ms above which a passing call is
 *                    classified "SLOW" instead of "PASS". Default 20000.
 *   SMOKE_DELAY_MS   (optional) delay between sequential probe calls, to stay
 *                    friendly to the rate limiter. Default 300.
 *   MONITOR_QUIET    (optional) "1" to suppress the per-tool table AND the
 *                    detailed `SUMMARY: {...}` line from stdout, printing only
 *                    a single non-revealing completion line instead (no tool
 *                    names, domains, backend names, or severity breakdown).
 *                    The full detail is UNAFFECTED in the JSON report file —
 *                    this only changes what a human/CI-log reader sees. This
 *                    repo's GitHub Actions logs are PUBLIC (world-readable),
 *                    so the CI workflow sets this to "1"; local/manual runs
 *                    leave it unset and get the full human-readable output.
 *
 * What it does:
 *   1. `tools/list` (live) -> single source of truth for the tool inventory.
 *      NEVER hardcodes the "does every tool exist" check against a fixed
 *      count — only cross-checks that every name in the embedded PROBES list
 *      below is present. A PROBE tool absent from the live list is a genuine
 *      regression on OUR surface (domain ①), not a backend problem, and is
 *      marked MISSING.
 *   2. STARTUP PREFLIGHT: before any network call, every PROBES entry is run
 *      through the same write-guard (assertExecutable) that will gate it at
 *      call time. A PROBES misconfiguration fails loudly at t=0, never after
 *      N live calls already happened (see preflightAssertAllProbesExecutable
 *      and the CRITICAL fix note on assertExecutable below).
 *   3. Executes ONE representative SAFE call per PROBE tool, sequentially,
 *      with `SMOKE_DELAY_MS` between calls (default 300ms). Any single
 *      network-level failure (httpStatus 0 — timeout OR a DNS/reset blip on
 *      the CI runner) gets ONE retry with a short backoff before being
 *      classified (see callToolWithNetworkRetry) — a transient runner hiccup
 *      must not misclassify as an ours-domain regression.
 *   4. `novada_proxy_account_create` is called WITHOUT `confirm` — this
 *      returns a dry-run confirmation preview (no write, no backend hit) and
 *      counts as a PASS. assertExecutable is ARGS-aware: it blocks this tool
 *      only when `confirm:true` is present, and blocks every other
 *      NEVER_EXECUTE_TOOL_NAMES member unconditionally by name. Every
 *      dispatch is wrapped in a try/catch so a write-guard throw classifies
 *      just THAT probe as an ours-domain error row instead of crashing the
 *      whole run (this exact ordering bug — guard-by-name-only, thrown
 *      outside any try/catch — previously FATAL-exited the run at probe #14
 *      and dropped all 16 scrapers; fixed 2026-07-24).
 *   5. Processing→poll-AND-RESUME disambiguation (TOW2-257 Phase 4): a
 *      scraper response whose text shows `status: processing` and
 *      `records: 0` means the platform is just slow, not broken (see
 *      npm-package/src/tools/scrape.ts's `pending` outcome). This script
 *      extracts the `task_id="..."` and RESUMES up to
 *      PROCESSING_POLL_MAX_ATTEMPTS times (default 4, ~10s apart between
 *      attempts) via the generic
 *      `novada_scrape({ platform, operation: <catalog id>, task_id })` —
 *      free, no re-charge. On any attempt: `records >= 1` → SLOW (works,
 *      just needed N poll(s)); a poll that resolves to a genuine Failed
 *      outcome (isError, e.g. a Novada-side task error code) → domain
 *      ③-backend FAIL immediately, no further attempts. STILL `status:
 *      processing` after every attempt is exhausted → status `"ASYNC"`
 *      (domain "-", severity none) — this is NORMAL async behavior for a
 *      slow-but-healthy platform, NOT a failure and NOT a ③-backend finding
 *      (this is what kills the recurring false daily red on
 *      amazon/x/tiktok/perplexity: previously ANY still-processing task
 *      after just ONE poll was misclassified as a ③-backend FAIL). ASYNC
 *      rows never count toward `oursCount`/`backendCount`/the exit code,
 *      exactly like PASS/SLOW — see buildSummary and main()'s `oursP0P1`
 *      computation. UNLESS no task_id could be extracted at all, in which
 *      case this is OUR extraction/format assumption breaking, not a
 *      backend problem, so it classifies ①-mcp-code and skips polling
 *      entirely (fixed 2026-07-24 — previously silently misrouted to ③).
 *   6. Classifies every result into a fault DOMAIN (①-mcp-code / ②-gateway /
 *      ③-backend / "-" pass) and a SEVERITY (P0/P1/P2/P3/none) — see the
 *      classifyFailure() doc comment below for the exact rubric, and
 *      monitoring/README.md for the human-readable table. A genuine
 *      INVALID_API_KEY auth error (the test key itself misconfigured/
 *      unprovisioned for scraper products) classifies ②-gateway/config, not
 *      ①-mcp-code — it is not a logic bug in this repo (fixed 2026-07-24).
 *   7. Prints an aligned human table + a SUMMARY line, and writes a dated JSON
 *      report to monitoring/reports/full-<UTC timestamp>.json (gitignored,
 *      artifact-only — see the repo root .gitignore's `reports/` rule). The
 *      summary carries both `maxSeverity` (across all domains) and
 *      `maxOursSeverity` (①/② rows only) so a backend-only event never reads
 *      as "we got paged" — render-report.py's 汇总 sheet headlines the latter.
 *      `summary.byStatus` is keyed by whatever `status` string each row got
 *      (PASS/SLOW/FAIL/MISSING/ASYNC) — no separate wiring needed per status,
 *      it falls out of buildSummary's generic reduce.
 *   8. Exit code: non-zero (1) ONLY when the run found an OURS-domain (①/②)
 *      finding at severity P0 or P1, OR a PROBE tool went MISSING from the
 *      live tool list. Backend-only (③) findings — including a full-blown
 *      "≥4 backend platforms down at once" systemic event — always exit 0:
 *      they are reported for visibility, never used to page us, because we
 *      don't own the Novada Scraper API backend. ASYNC findings (a scraper
 *      task still processing after every resume attempt) are, likewise,
 *      never a failure and never affect the exit code — domain "-" puts
 *      them outside both `oursP0P1` and `backendCount` by construction.
 *   9. TEST-KEY CONFIG faults are NOT paged (2026-08-27). An INVALID_API_KEY
 *      or free-gateway-cap rejection means the shared NOVADA_TEST_KEY itself
 *      is unfunded/unprovisioned/over-cap — test-infra state, NOT a product
 *      regression (classifyFailure already labels these "not a code bug").
 *      Such rows are marked `configFault:true` and EXCLUDED from the exit-1
 *      set, the ≥4-ours escalation, and oursCount — so a dead/unfunded test
 *      key can never cry-wolf a red wall (same green-on-noise principle as the
 *      0.9.35 canary work + the reconcile-cron skip-clean). They stay LOUD in
 *      the report via summary.testKeyDegradedCount + summary.monitoringDegraded
 *      (and a non-quiet DEGRADED line) so a silently-dead key that blinds the
 *      monitor is visible, never a misleading green. A real ①-mcp-code bug, a
 *      genuine HTTP-5xx/network ②-gateway fault, or a MISSING tool STILL pages
 *      — configFault is set ONLY on the two test-key signals, never on a real
 *      server/network ②-gateway fault.

// ─── V3-N1 / C-2 FIX (2026-09-03): scraper "substance" gate ─────────────────
// FINDING (novada-test-engineering ledger 2026-09-02-full-evaluation,
// findings/V3-verification-CX.md §C-2 + §V3-N1): this script's PASS
// criterion for a scraper probe was `records >= 1` ONLY (see the plain
// `if (res.ok) { status: ...PASS... }` branch in runProbe, and the poll
// loop's `pollRecords >= 1` branch). duckduckgo's `web_search` operation can
// return a "bare SERP envelope" on a broken/schema-mismatched upstream
// response — no `organic_results` array anywhere in the payload, so
// scrape.ts's own extractRecords() (RECORD_ARRAY_KEYS fallback,
// npm-package/src/tools/scrape.ts:875-892, imported/tested read-only for
// this fix, never edited — this repo's REDLINE forbids touching product
// code) wraps the WHOLE envelope object as a single synthetic "record"
// ({search_metadata, spider_parameter, search_information, related_searches,
// get_news, cache_status, code} — no title/link anywhere, confirmed against
// scrape.ts:390 and :875-892). That single synthetic record makes
// `records: 1` true, so the OLD predicate scored PASS on 3/3 live samples
// with ZERO usable organic results (evidence/C-live-transcripts.md's two
// manual DDG calls + the V3 auditor's independent 3rd sample). The monitor
// was blind to this for weeks — "PASS records:1" days were very likely the
// same empty envelope every time.
//
// FIX: PASS now requires records >= 1 AND, for every scraper-family probe,
// that the FIRST returned record carries at least one non-empty field from
// this operation's required SUBSTANCE_TABLE entry — the SAME generic
// title/price/username/link vocabulary scrape.ts's own KEY_COLUMN_PRIORITY
// uses (npm-package/src/tools/scrape.ts:916-922) to decide what a "real"
// record looks like, so this is grounded in the product's own conventions,

// CLASS-NOT-INSTANCE: SUBSTANCE_TABLE has one row per `catalogOpId` this
// script's own PROBES list exercises above — 15 distinct catalog operations
// across all 16 scraper probes (the generic `novada_scrape` probe shares
// google_search's row with `novada_scrape_google`) — covering the SERP,
// product, profile, video, repository, and answer families, not just
// duckduckgo. See full-tools-probe.selftest.mjs's coverage assertion, which
// fails if a future isScraper:true PROBES entry's catalogOpId has no row
// here.
//
// A records>=1 response that FAILS its substance check classifies
// ③-backend/P2 (an upstream schema/data-quality incident, visible in every
// report and every exit-0 "backend-only" summary line) — it is NEVER
// silenced and NEVER added to BACKEND_KNOWN_FLAKY_PLATFORMS
// (monitoring/smoke/tool-probes.mjs). Adding duckduckgo to that list would
// BE the "allowlist that hides DDG" this fix exists to prevent — known-flaky
// rows are P3 and never escalate; a substance failure must stay a normal,
// always-visible P2 like any other backend incident.
//
// Every isScraper:true PROBES entry above now explicitly requests
// `format: "json"` so the substance check can parse real, unflattened
// upstream fields out of the ```json ... ``` fence (scrape.ts's json
// branch, :1687-1706, emits `JSON.stringify(cleanRecords, ...)` — the RAW
// per-record objects, already through normalizeProductRecord's price/
// availability reconciliation) instead of grep-matching a markdown table's
// flattened dot-path columns. That distinction matters: duckduckgo's own
// bare envelope has a `get_news` array whose items carry a REAL `title` key
// (news headlines) — if this fix loosely substring-matched "title" against
// a flattened markdown column list, `get_news.0.title` would false-positive
// as organic-search substance. Requiring an EXACT top-level JSON key on the
// FIRST record (not a nested/prefixed dot-path) avoids that trap entirely.

 * Classify a FAILING probe result into {domain, severity, note}.
 *
 * Priority order (first match wins) — reordered 2026-07-24 per code review:
 *   1. INVALID_API_KEY signal -> ②-gateway/config (P0/P1). Checked FIRST and
 *      unconditionally: a broken test key would surface identically on every
 *      scraper platform regardless of that platform's flakiness, and it is
 *      unambiguously OUR test-infra to fix (rotate/provision the key), never
 *      the platform's fault.
 *   2. FREE_CAP_RE signal (2026-07-30 incident) -> ②-gateway/config (P0/P1).
 *      Checked SECOND, immediately after INVALID_API_KEY and unconditionally
 *      BEFORE the isFlaky branch below: the test key being over the hosted
 *      free-gateway cap surfaces identically on every tool including
 *      known-flaky scraper platforms, and a flaky platform must not be
 *      allowed to swallow it into ③-backend — it is billing/test-infra to
 *      fix (top up the key or fix the gateway paid-exemption), never a code
 *      bug and never a backend outage.
 *   3. Known-flaky backend platform (TOW2-305) -> ③-backend, P3 — ALWAYS,
 *      including when the specific failure mode is a stuck/still-processing
 *      task after one poll (fixed 2026-07-24: previously the
 *      stillProcessingAfterPoll branch was checked first and always
 *      returned P2, even for a documented-chronic-flake platform).
 *   4. Scraper task still stuck after the one poll attempt (non-flaky
 *      platform) -> ③-backend, P2.
 *   5. Our own validation/logic error text (bad op id, missing required
 *      param, etc.) -> ①-mcp-code — this is OUR schema/preflight, not theirs.
 *   6. HTTP 5xx, or ANY network-level failure (httpStatus === 0, whether or
 *      not the message says "timeout" — after callToolWithNetworkRetry's one
 *      retry, a lingering httpStatus 0 means the client never reached the
 *      server) -> ②-gateway.
 *   7. Backend/upstream signal text (BACKEND_SIGNAL_RE, or the shared
 *      isBackendSignal() from tool-probes.mjs — e.g. the scraper `50004:
 *      context deadline exceeded` timeout, reproduced 2026-07-28 via a raw
 *      curl with zero MCP involved) -> ③-backend. Checked for EVERY tool,
 *      regardless of platform — this is what keeps a bare backend outage from
 *      defaulting to ①-mcp-code at step 8 below for any platform not already
 *      on the known-flaky list.
 *   8. Anything else unclassified -> ①-mcp-code (fail-safe toward "ours until
 *      proven otherwise" — we'd rather over-investigate a real backend blip
 *      once than silently blame the backend for something we broke).

 * else P1 (single-tool). The "many tools affected" (-> P0) and "≥4 backend
 * platforms at once" (-> P1 systemic) escalations are applied afterward, over
