/**
 * monitoring/report/linear-sync.mjs
 *
 * Delivers the Layer D (full-tools probe) daily report data PRIVATELY via
 * Linear. This repo (NovadaLabs/Novada-mcp) is PUBLIC — its Actions logs and
 * artifacts are world-readable — so the actual report DATA (which backends
 * are down, our fault-domain analysis) must never land there. Instead, THIS
 * script delivers EVERYTHING to Linear (a private workspace) directly:
 *   - an alert issue (on any P0/P1/P2 finding) or a dated heartbeat comment
 *     (on green days), with a compact inline markdown summary; AND
 *   - the full report's rendered `.xlsx` file, uploaded as a genuine Linear
 *     file attachment via Linear's GraphQL file-upload flow, linked from the
 *     issue/comment body.
 * There is no public artifact and no separate archive repo — Linear is the
 * only delivery destination. See monitoring/README.md's "Privacy model"
 * section for the full picture.
 *
 * Dependency-free: Node >=20 built-in `fetch`/`fs` + a hand-written GraphQL
 * query/mutation set against Linear's public API
 * (https://api.linear.app/graphql — see https://linear.app/developers/graphql).
 *
 * ── DRY-RUN BY DEFAULT (critical safety invariant) ──────────────────────────
 * Every mutation (issueCreate, commentCreate, fileUpload + the follow-up PUT)
 * is a NO-OP unless explicitly armed via `--send` on the CLI or
 * `LINEAR_SYNC_LIVE=1` in the environment. Read-only resolution
 * (team/project/label/tracker lookups) still runs in dry-run — it validates
 * config without writing anything. This exists because an earlier version of
 * this script fired a live mutation on ANY run with a valid key present (no
 * separate arm switch), which is exactly how a local sanity-check run
 * against a real `LINEAR_API_KEY` accidentally created a real Linear issue
 * during development (TOW2-336, since canceled/relabeled). The CI workflow
 * sets `LINEAR_SYNC_LIVE: "1"` on its "Sync report to Linear" step so
 * scheduled runs still deliver for real; every other invocation (local,
 * ad-hoc, an offline self-test importing this module) defaults to
 * preview-only.
 *
 * A companion OFFLINE self-test lives at
 * monitoring/report/linear-sync.selftest.mjs — it imports this module's
 * exported pipeline (runSync/createIssue/createComment/uploadFileToLinear/
 * etc.), injects a stub GraphQL transport AND a stub file uploader (no
 * network, no key needed), and asserts that dry-run mode never fires a
 * mutation or upload, and that live mode fires exactly the expected ones —
 * including the fail-soft path when the upload itself fails. Run it after
 * any change to this file:
 *   node monitoring/report/linear-sync.selftest.mjs
 *
 * Env vars:
 *   LINEAR_API_KEY        (required) Linear personal API key. NEVER
 *                          hardcode, NEVER printed — on error, only the
 *                          GraphQL/HTTP error message is logged, never the
 *                          key itself (it is sent solely as the
 *                          Authorization header value).
 *   LINEAR_SYNC_LIVE       (optional) "1" to arm real mutations (see the
 *                          DRY-RUN section above). Same effect as passing
 *                          `--send` on the CLI.
 *
 * Resolution (by NAME, fail-soft — a name that doesn't resolve is logged and
 * that field is skipped, this script never crashes on a missing name):
 *   - team:    "TongWu"
 *   - project: "Novada MCP — Daily Monitoring Loop"
 *   - label:   "Wutong"
 *
 * Behavior:
 *   - The worse of summary.maxOursSeverity / summary.maxSeverity is P0, P1,
 *     or P2 -> create a NEW issue titled
 *     "[MCP Daily] <date> · <worst-sev> · <passN>/<total> ok · backend down: <names>",
 *     body = a compact markdown table (worst -> best) + the ours/backend
 *     split + a link to the `.xlsx` file attached directly to this issue.
 *     Assigned to the API key's own viewer (`me`), labeled Wutong.
 *   - Otherwise (all green, or only P3 findings) -> find-or-create a SINGLE
 *     rolling tracker issue "MCP Daily Monitor — heartbeat" and post a dated
 *     comment on it (with the same attached-`.xlsx` link). Never opens a new
 *     issue on a green day. If the SEARCH for the tracker itself fails
 *     (network/GraphQL error), this is treated as "unknown", NOT "not
 *     found" — delivery is skipped for this run rather than risking a
 *     duplicate tracker issue on a transient blip.
 *
 * Failure mode: ANY error (missing key, missing report file, network
 * failure, GraphQL error, file-upload failure) is logged to stderr and this
 * script exits 0 — a Linear delivery failure must never fail the monitor run
 * itself; the probe's own exit code (set by full-tools-probe.mjs) is what
 * actually matters for CI. The file-upload step specifically is fail-soft in
 * isolation too: if it throws, the issue/comment is still created with the
 * inline summary plus a note that the attachment upload failed — see
 * `uploadFileToLinear` and its caller below.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   LINEAR_API_KEY=<key> node monitoring/report/linear-sync.mjs             # dry-run (preview only)
 *   LINEAR_API_KEY=<key> LINEAR_SYNC_LIVE=1 node monitoring/report/linear-sync.mjs   # live delivery
 *   LINEAR_API_KEY=<key> node monitoring/report/linear-sync.mjs --send      # live delivery (CLI form)

 * required by Linear's own documented example — omitting `uploadFile.headers`
 * causes a 403 from the underlying signed-URL storage):
