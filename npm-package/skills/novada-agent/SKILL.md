# Novada Agent Skill

You have access to Novada's **38** curated MCP tools (the set `novada_discover` lists; the hosted endpoint exposes a core-derived **30**-tool subset). This skill tells you exactly which tool to use when and how to use it effectively. Older names like `novada_unblock`, `novada_verify`, and `novada_health` still work as back-compat aliases — the current tools are shown below.

Deep-dive companion skills: `novada-scrape` (platform scrapers + price fields), `novada-extract` (single/batch extraction), `novada-browser` (CDP automation), `novada-proxy` (proxy type selection + escalation), `novada-site-copy` (whole-site copying / RAG ingestion).

## Tool Selection — Decision Tree

```
Need web data?
├── Have specific URLs already? → novada_extract
├── Need to find URLs first?
│   ├── Question needs facts/prices/current events (accuracy matters)?
│   │   ├── 1 source → novada_search THEN novada_extract top result (read it)
│   │   └── Multiple sources → novada_research (reads full content for you — cheaper than N search+extract)
│   ├── Just locating pages (no answer needed yet) → novada_search
│   ├── Explore an entire site → novada_map or novada_crawl
│   └── Multi-faceted question → novada_research
└── Want ranked, cited source material to reason over? → novada_research

Need structured platform data (Amazon, TikTok, LinkedIn…)? → novada_scrape_<platform> if one of the 15 dedicated platform tools exists for it, else generic novada_scrape
Need proxy credentials for your own HTTP requests? → novada_proxy
Page blocked or JS-heavy, need raw HTML? → novada_extract (format:"html", render:"render")
Need to click/fill/screenshot a page? → novada_browser
Check account balance / plans / entitlements? → novada_account
```

**Escalation ladder (pick the lowest rung that answers the question):**
`novada_search` (locate) → `novada_extract` top result (read one page) → `novada_research` (read many sources)

Also read `novada://guide` — it contains the full decision tree and workflow patterns.

## Core Tools

### `novada_search`

**When:** Find pages matching a query. You know what you're looking for, not where it lives.

**Returns: titles, URLs, snippets only.** Snippets are for locating pages, not for answering questions. If the answer needs to be correct (facts, prices, current events, "what does X say"), you MUST either open the top result(s) with `novada_extract`, or use `novada_research` (which reads full sources for you). Never answer a substantive question from snippets alone.

**Key parameters:**
- `query` — your search string
- `engine` — `google` (default), `duckduckgo`, `yandex` (`bing` and `yahoo` are NOT supported — return an error)
- `num` — results count, 1-20 (default 10)
- `time_range` — `day`, `week`, `month`, `year`
- `include_domains` / `exclude_domains` — up to 10 domains each
- `country` — ISO code for geo-targeting (195 countries supported)

**When NOT to use:** You already have the URL — use `novada_extract` instead. You need a factual answer — search gives you candidates to read, not the answer itself.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "query": "Claude API function calling examples 2025",
  "engine": "google",
  "num": 5,
  "time_range": "year",
  "include_domains": ["anthropic.com", "github.com"]
}
```

### `novada_extract`

**When:** You have specific URLs and need their content.

**Key parameters:**
- `url` — single URL string, or array of up to 10 URLs for parallel batch
- `urls` — alias for `url` when passing multiple URLs; preferred for batch workflows
- `format` — `markdown` (default), `text`, `html`
- `render` — `auto` (default), `static`, `render` (Web Unblocker), `browser` (full CDP)
- `query` — optional: focuses the content summary on a specific aspect
- `fields` — optional: specific fields to extract, e.g. `["price", "author", "rating"]` (max 20)
- `max_chars` — optional: max characters to return (default 25000, max 100000). Do NOT set to 100000 by default.

**Batch mode:** Pass `url: ["url1", "url2"]` or `urls: ["url1", "url2"]` to extract multiple pages in one call — faster than calling extract once per URL.

**When NOT to use:** You don't have URLs yet — use `novada_search` or `novada_map` first.

**Example (single):**
```json
{ "url": "https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/getting-started", "format": "markdown" }
```

**Example (batch):**
```json
{
  "url": ["https://example.com/page1", "https://example.com/page2"],
  "format": "markdown",
  "query": "pricing information"
}
```

---

### `novada_crawl`

**When:** You need content from multiple pages of a site but don't have all URLs.

**Key parameters:**
- `url` — starting URL (root)
- `max_pages` — 1-20 (default 5)
- `strategy` — `bfs` (breadth-first, broad coverage) or `dfs` (depth-first, deep paths)
- `select_paths` — glob patterns to restrict to specific paths, e.g. `["/docs/**"]`
- `exclude_paths` — glob patterns to skip, e.g. `["/blog/**", "/changelog/**"]`
- `instructions` — natural language hint: `"only API reference pages"`

**When NOT to use:**
- You just want a list of URLs → use `novada_map` instead (no content extraction)
- You already have all URLs → use `novada_extract` batch

**Example:**
```json
{
  "url": "https://docs.example.com",
  "max_pages": 10,
  "strategy": "bfs",
  "select_paths": ["/api/**"],
  "instructions": "only API endpoint reference pages, skip tutorials"
}
```

---

### `novada_map`

**When:** You need to discover URLs on a site without extracting their content. Site exploration, inventory, link collection.

**Key parameters:**
- `url` — root URL to map
- `limit` — max URLs to return, 1-100 (default 50)
- `max_depth` — link hops from root, 1-5 (default 2)
- `search` — optional keyword to filter returned URLs
- `include_subdomains` — include URLs on subdomains (default false)

**Use then chain:** `novada_map` → filter the URL list → `novada_extract` batch on selected URLs. This is more efficient than `novada_crawl` when you need selective extraction.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "url": "https://docs.example.com",
  "limit": 100,
  "max_depth": 3,
  "search": "authentication"
}
```

---

### `novada_research`

**When:** You have a question that needs multiple sources. You want ranked, cited source material gathered in one call — then you compose the answer.

**What it does:** Generates 3-10 parallel search queries, deduplicates unique sources, extracts full content from the top ones, and returns the most relevant passages under numbered source sections (CITED SOURCE MATERIAL — extractive, not a generated prose report). You write the final answer from it.

**Key parameters:**
- `question` — the research question (full sentence works best)
- `depth` — `auto` (default: picks quick or deep by question length, never comprehensive), `quick` (3 searches), `deep` (6), `comprehensive` (8-9)
- `focus` — optional: `"technical implementation"`, `"business impact"`, `"recent news only"`

**When NOT to use:** You need real-time data or very specific factual lookups — `novada_search` is more precise. You want a finished prose report — this returns source material, not an answer.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "question": "What are the best practices for implementing JWT refresh token rotation in 2025?",
  "depth": "deep",
  "focus": "security and implementation"
}
```

---

### `novada_proxy`

**When:** You need to route your own HTTP requests through residential, mobile, ISP, or datacenter IPs — for geo-targeting, IP rotation, or bypassing IP-based rate limits.

**Key parameters:**
- `type` — `residential` (default), `mobile`, `isp`, `datacenter`
- `country` — ISO 2-letter code (`us`, `gb`, `de`)
- `city` — city-level targeting (requires `country`)
- `session_id` — sticky session — same ID returns same IP for multi-step workflows
- `format` — `url` (default, for Node.js/Python), `env` (shell export commands), `curl` (--proxy flag)

**When NOT to use:** Web page extraction (use `novada_extract` — proxy is automatic). Web search (use `novada_search`).

**Example:**
```json
{ "type": "residential", "country": "us", "session_id": "my-session", "format": "env" }
```

---

### `novada_scrape`

**When:** You need clean, structured records from a known platform — not raw HTML but tabular data. Supports 16 platforms (~87 operations): Amazon, Walmart, SHEIN, Google (incl. Shopping), Bing, DuckDuckGo, Yandex, X/Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, GitHub, ChatGPT, Perplexity.

**Key parameters:**
- `platform` — domain, e.g. `amazon.com`, `tiktok.com`, `linkedin.com`
- `operation` — operation ID, e.g. `amazon_product_keywords`, `tiktok_posts_url`
- `params` — operation-specific params, e.g. `{ "keyword": "iphone 16", "num": 5 }`
- `limit` — max records (1-100, default 20)
- `format` — `markdown` (default, agent-optimized), `json` (programmatic)

**Discover platforms:** Read the `novada://scraper-platforms` MCP resource for the complete list with operation IDs and required params.

**When NOT to use:** General web pages not on the platform list (use `novada_extract` or `novada_crawl`). Unknown domains.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "platform": "amazon.com",
  "operation": "amazon_product_keywords",
  "params": { "keyword": "iphone 16", "num": 5 },
  "format": "json"
}
```

### `novada_scrape_<platform>` — 15 dedicated per-platform scrapers

**When:** The platform is one of the 15 below. Prefer the dedicated tool over generic `novada_scrape` for these — its `operation` parameter is a **closed, typed enum** scoped to that one platform, so an agent literally cannot pick an operation that belongs to a different platform or doesn't exist. That eliminates the two most common `novada_scrape` failure modes: error 11008 (invalid platform name) and operation-guessing against the wrong platform's op list. Same output rendering as `novada_scrape` (markdown/json/csv/excel/html/toon).

| Tool | Platform | Ops |
|------|----------|-----|
| `novada_scrape_amazon` | amazon.com | 10 |
| `novada_scrape_google` | google.com (web, AI Mode, Maps, Shopping, Jobs, Hotels, Videos) | 13 |
| `novada_scrape_bing` | bing.com | 4 |
| `novada_scrape_duckduckgo` | duckduckgo.com | 1 |
| `novada_scrape_yandex` | yandex.com | 1 |
| `novada_scrape_youtube` | youtube.com | 13 |
| `novada_scrape_instagram` | instagram.com | 7 |
| `novada_scrape_facebook` | facebook.com | 6 |
| `novada_scrape_tiktok` | tiktok.com | 5 |
| `novada_scrape_x` | x.com / twitter.com | 3 |
| `novada_scrape_walmart` | walmart.com | 5 |
| `novada_scrape_shein` | shein.com | 2 (3 known backend_broken ops excluded) |
| `novada_scrape_linkedin` | linkedin.com | 4 |
| `novada_scrape_github` | github.com | 3 |
| `novada_scrape_perplexity` | perplexity.ai | 2 |

**When NOT to use:** The platform isn't in this list (e.g. Walmart is covered, but a platform not among the 16 in the `novada_scrape` catalog is not — use `novada_extract`/`novada_crawl`). ChatGPT has no dedicated tool — its two catalog operations are backend-dead; use generic `novada_scrape` only if the backend is later fixed.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "operation": "linkedin_company_information_url",
  "params": { "url": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/anthropic/" }
}
```

### `novada_verify` (back-compat alias — still works)

**When:** You have a factual claim and need to check whether web sources support it before citing it.

**What it does:** Runs 3 parallel searches (supporting, skeptical, neutral fact-check angles) and returns a structured verdict: `supported` / `unsupported` / `contested` / `insufficient_data`. Confidence score 0–100 indicates how far from a 50/50 split.

**Key parameters:**
- `claim` — the factual statement to verify (min 10 chars)
- `context` — optional: narrows search scope, e.g. `"as of 2024"`, `"in the US"`

**When NOT to use:** Open-ended questions (use `novada_research`). Reading a specific URL (use `novada_extract`). Verdict is signal-based, not a definitive ruling.

**Example:**
```json
{ "claim": "The Eiffel Tower is 330 meters tall", "context": "as of 2024" }
```

---

### Raw HTML — use `novada_extract` (`novada_unblock` is a back-compat alias)

**When:** You need the raw rendered HTML of a blocked or JS-heavy page.

**How:** Call `novada_extract` with `format: "html"` and `render: "render"` (Web Unblocker) or `render: "browser"` (full Chromium CDP for complex SPAs). The old `novada_unblock({url, method})` still dispatches to this.

**When NOT to use:** If you want cleaned text (use `novada_extract` with `render="render"` and the default markdown format — it returns clean markdown). Structured platform data (use `novada_scrape`).

**Example:**
```json
{ "url": "https://example.com/protected", "format": "html", "render": "render" }
```

---

### `novada_browser`

**When:** You need to interact with a web page — click buttons, fill forms, scroll, take screenshots, or execute JavaScript. Up to 20 chained actions per session.

**Key parameters:**
- `actions` — ordered list of browser actions (max 20)
- `session_id` — optional: maintain state (cookies, login) across multiple calls; sessions expire after 10 min of inactivity

**Supported actions:** `navigate`, `click`, `type`, `screenshot`, `aria_snapshot`, `evaluate`, `wait`, `scroll`, `hover`, `press_key`, `select`

**Auth:** `NOVADA_API_KEY` auto-provisions Browser API credentials; `NOVADA_BROWSER_WS` is optional (overrides auto-provision). Runs on both local and hosted; only cross-call persistent sessions are local-only. The `country` param is accepted but not yet applied to the exit node — do not rely on it for geo-routing.

**When NOT to use:** Simple page reading (use `novada_extract`). Structured data from a known platform (use `novada_scrape`). Raw HTML without interaction (use `novada_extract` with `format: "html"`).

**Example:**
```json
{
  "actions": [
    { "action": "navigate", "url": "https://example.com/login" },
    { "action": "type", "selector": "#email", "text": "user@example.com" },
    { "action": "type", "selector": "#password", "text": "pass" },
    { "action": "click", "selector": "button[type=submit]" },
    { "action": "aria_snapshot" }
  ]
}
```

---

### `novada_account`

**When:** First-time setup, diagnosing why a tool is failing, or checking your balance, plans, and product entitlements. (The old `novada_health` / `novada_health_all` names dispatch here.)

**Key parameters:** `section` — `summary` (default: wallet balance + plan quotas + recent capture logs + entitlements), `balance`, `usage`, `plans`, `traffic`.

**What it returns:** For `summary`, a full dashboard of wallet balance, per-product plan quotas, and proxy/browser entitlements.

**When NOT to use:** This is an account/diagnostic tool. Don't call it in tight production loops unless you're debugging or checking quota.

**Example:**
```json
{ "section": "summary" }
```

## Common Workflows

### Research + Extract
1. `novada_research` for the broad answer
2. Identify key sources from the report
3. `novada_extract` on the most relevant URLs for full content

### Competitive Analysis
1. `novada_search` for competitor pages
2. `novada_extract` batch on top results
3. Synthesize findings

### Full Site Documentation Extraction
1. `novada_map` to discover all doc URLs
2. Filter to relevant paths
3. `novada_extract` batch (up to 10 per call) on filtered list

### Fresh News
1. `novada_search` with `time_range: "week"` or `start_date`
2. `novada_extract` on top 3-5 results

---

## Rules

1. **Batch > sequential**: Always use `novada_extract` with a URL array instead of multiple single-URL calls.
2. **Map before crawl for selective work**: If you only need specific pages, `novada_map` + filter + `novada_extract` is more efficient than `novada_crawl`.
3. **Use `focus` in research**: A focused research question produces tighter, more relevant sub-queries.
4. **Prefer `engine="google"`**: It is the fastest and most reliable. `bing` and `yahoo` are unsupported (return an error); `duckduckgo`/`yandex` are slower fallbacks.
5. **`novada_research` is not a search**: It returns ranked, cited source material to reason over (extractive — you compose the answer), not raw URLs or a finished report. Don't use it for a single lookup.
6. **Deliverable-first for tabular results**: If a result (e.g. from `novada_scrape`) has more than ~10 records, default to producing a downloadable file (xlsx/csv/json — see `novada_scrape`'s Format guide) instead of dumping every row as inline text. Lead your response with the file reference, not a prose recap. Under ~10 records, inline text is still correct.
7. **Snippets ≠ answers (depth rule)**: `novada_search` returns snippets for locating pages. If accuracy matters (facts, prices, current events), open the top 1-3 results with `novada_extract` and read the actual content before answering. For multi-source questions, ONE `novada_research` call is cheaper and better than N manual search+extract calls — prefer it.
8. **Do not thrash on transient errors**: Errors like "No approval received" are auto-retried by the server. Do NOT re-issue the same call manually on a transient error — that double-charges. Retry manually only on an explicit, persistent failure.
