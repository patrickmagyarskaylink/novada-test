// ─── Perplexity operation → catalog scraper_id map (single source of truth) ─
// Tools-v2: novada_scrape_perplexity, built on the config-driven platform-scraper
// factory (src/tools/platform_scraper.ts — see scrape_amazon.ts for the
// proof-of-pattern). Friendly, human-readable operation names for
// novada_scrape_perplexity, each mapped deterministically to the exact `slug`
// (== scraper_id) in src/data/scraper_catalog.ts's perplexity.ai block.
//
// All 2 perplexity.ai catalog operations are status:"ok" as of the 2026-07-13 live
// verification pass — none are excluded here. If a future catalog refresh marks
// either backend_broken, tests/tools/platform-scraper-catalog.test.ts will fail CI
// until it is removed from this map.
//
// ChatGPT (chatgpt.com), Perplexity's sibling AI-answer platform in the catalog,
// has NO novada_scrape_chatgpt tool: its only 2 catalog operations
// (chatgpt_answer_searchterm, chatgpt_answer_url) are BOTH status:"backend_broken"
// ("submit hangs >120s — scraper likely disabled/broken", verified 2026-07-13) — a
// tool exposing zero working operations would be worse than no tool at all.
