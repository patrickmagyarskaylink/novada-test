/**
 * validate.ts — the ONE shared parameter-validation formatter for the whole
 * tool surface (F-12, F-2, P-4).
 *
 * Before this file existed, "turn a ZodError into agent-facing text" was
 * hand-rolled independently at (at least) four sites — index.ts's main
 * dispatch catch, index.ts's novada_search_feedback catch (which used a
 * DIFFERENT off-contract token (the literal text "Next step" + a colon)
 * instead of the documented `agent_instruction:`
 * convention), and tools/setup.ts + tools/session_stats.ts's own pre-wrap-into-
 * Error variants — each with a slightly different level of enum enrichment
 * and none of them templating on the issue's *class* (missing vs wrong-type
 * vs bad-enum vs too-short vs unknown-key vs union-mismatch all produced the
 * same generic "Fix the parameter(s) listed above" paragraph).
 *
 * This module exports:
 *   - formatZodIssue()  — one issue -> one instruction fragment, templated on
 *                         the Zod v4 issue `code` (F-12).
 *   - formatZodError()  — the full "Invalid parameters for X: ... agent_instruction: ..."
 *                         block, reused everywhere in index.ts that formats a
 *                         ZodError (collapses the near-duplicate copies within
 *                         this worker's file ownership — see the note at the
 *                         bottom about the two sites this pass could NOT reach).
 *   - computeUnknownKeyWarning() — F-2's warn-don't-reject mechanism, DERIVED
 *                         from the live tool registry's declared inputSchema
 *                         (not a hand-written per-tool key list), so a new
 *                         38th/39th/Nth tool needs zero new branches here.

 * Tools whose Zod schema actually wires camelCase aliasing — either via

 * both in tools/types.ts). ONLY for a tool in this set is `toCamelCase(key)`
 * of a declared snake_case key an ACTUALLY-ACCEPTED parameter — not just a
 * mechanical guess.
 *
 * F-2 false-negative fix (2026-09-03 ledger-closure audit, finding #5):
 * `withCamelCaseAliases` wraps a schema in `z.preprocess`, which is INVISIBLE
 * to `inputSchema.properties` (the JSON Schema this module reads — see that
 * function's own doc comment in tools/types.ts: "the camelCase keys never
 * appear in the agent-facing JSON schema"). The previous version of this
 * module ran `toCamelCase()` over EVERY declared key on EVERY tool
 * regardless of whether that tool's schema actually wires aliasing —
 * accurate by coincidence for aliased tools, silently wrong for every other
 * tool with a multi-word snake_case key. Concretely:
 * `novada_research({startDate: "2024-01-01"})` produced ZERO warning even
 * though `ResearchParamsSchema` (tools/types.ts) is a bare `z.object(...)`
 * with no `withCamelCaseAliases` wrapper, so `startDate` is NOT a real
 * parameter — Zod's non-strict default silently DROPS it and the call
 * quietly does nothing.
 *
 * Investigated (2026-09 fix pass): every current `withCamelCaseAliases` /
 * bespoke-preprocess call site's alias map covers 100% of that schema's
 * declared multi-word snake_case keys (no partial coverage found anywhere in
 * tools/types.ts or tools/platform_scraper.ts today) — so "does this tool
 * alias at all" is an accurate, verified proxy for "is toCamelCase(key)
 * known for this tool", and a per-tool allowlist (rather than a hand-kept
 * per-key table) is the minimal correct fix.
 *
 * This module cannot import the real alias maps directly — they live inside
 * z.preprocess closures in tools/types.ts / tools/platform_scraper.ts, not on
 * inputSchema.properties, and pulling them out into an importable shape is
 * outside this fix's file-ownership scope. So membership here is a hand-swept
 * enumeration, verified against every current alias call site — NOT
 * self-verifying the way reading inputSchema.properties directly would be.
 * If a schema gains/loses camelCase aliasing, THIS LIST must be updated in
 * lockstep or a future tool will silently regress back into this class of
 * false-negative (or, less dangerously, false-positive). A stronger
 * structural fix would export the alias maps themselves from tools/types.ts
 * for this module to read — flagged here for a follow-up pass.
