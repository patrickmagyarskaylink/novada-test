# Novada MCP — Changelog

All notable changes are recorded here in reverse chronological order.

---

## [Unreleased]

---

## [0.9.37] — 2026-08-26

Combined release candidate merging two independently code-reviewed branches: account error-classification/param fixes (`fix/account-not-provisioned`) and hosted-server telemetry delivery hardening (`fix/telemetry-100`). Zero file overlap between the two branches — merged clean, no conflicts.

### Fixed
- **`novada_account` / `novada_plan_balance_all`: business code 11009 now classifies as "not provisioned," not a generic service error** — including the Static ISP product, which was missed by the original class-sweep and is now checked alongside every other product on the shared not-provisioned path (class-not-instance fix).
- **`novada_account` (`section=usage`, capture logs): `capture_recent` no longer errors** — the request now passes both `start_time` and `end_time` to the underlying `capture_logs` call (the first fix passed only `start_time` and was incomplete).

### Changed (hosted server — `mcp.novada.com`, not part of the npm package)
- **Telemetry delivery hardened toward 100% outbox durability**: events are captured before the response is awaited (no more fire-and-forget drops on cold shutdown), a reconcile sweep re-sends unconfirmed pushes, a dead-state is introduced for permanently-undeliverable events instead of retrying forever, and new health/canary scripts (`telemetry-health.mjs`, `telemetry-delivery-canary.mjs`) monitor delivery in production. The reconcile sweep is triggered by a **GitHub Actions scheduled workflow** (`.github/workflows/reconcile-cron.yml`) POSTing to `/api/reconcile` roughly every **5-15 minutes** — not a Vercel Cron, because this project runs on the Vercel Hobby plan, which doesn't support per-minute cron (upgrade to Vercel Pro for native per-minute cron). Delivery still reaches **eventually 100%, nothing permanently dropped** regardless of cadence, since the drainer retries the same undelivered backlog until it succeeds. Ships with an **unapplied** migration (`hosted-server/migrations/2026-08-26-mcp-events-push-status-dead.sql`) — owner must apply it before deploy.

---

## [0.9.32] — 2026-07-22

Correctness patch found by dogfooding `novada_extract`/`novada_site_copy` against Novada's own `.md` docs (TOW2-307), plus a correction to one external-audit claim. No new tools — count stays **38** (self-host) / **30** (hosted).

### Fixed
- **Markdown / plain-text bodies are no longer corrupted by Turndown (TOW2-307).** `novada_extract` and `novada_site_copy` used to run every non-PDF/non-JSON response body through Turndown (the HTML→markdown converter), *including* bodies the origin already served as `text/markdown` or `text/plain`. Turndown assumes HTML input: its text-node escaping pass escapes every markdown-significant character (`*`, `_`, `[`, `]`, backtick), and its whitespace pass collapses real newlines — so a `.md` docs page (e.g. developer.novada.com's GitBook `.md` endpoints) arrived escaped and flattened before an agent or disk ever saw it. Both tools now branch on content-type and return `text/markdown`/`text/plain` bodies **verbatim**, ahead of the HTML default.
- **Anti-HTML guard on the passthrough gate.** `text/markdown` (an explicit, trusted declaration) always passes through; `text/plain` passes through **only when the body isn't actually HTML**. Origins that mislabel HTML as `text/plain` (raw CDNs, misconfigured servers) now fall through to real HTML extraction instead of (a) leaking raw `<…>` tags into the output and (b) short-circuiting `novada_site_copy`'s JS-render escalation. Mirrors the `application/json` branch's long-standing `startsWith("<")` guard, in both `extract.ts` response branches and `site_copy.ts`.
- **Honest content-type label.** The `novada_extract` passthrough header now reports the *real* `Content-Type` the origin sent (charset stripped), not a label inferred from the body's shape — a markdown-shaped `text/plain` body is reported as `text/plain`.
- **Tool count in resource descriptions is now dynamic.** `novada://guide` and `novada://llms-txt` derive the count from `TOOL_REGISTRY.length` instead of a hardcoded number that had drifted (was "23").

### Testing / Notes
- **The audited "raw 429 leak" is not real — corrected with a regression test.** An external audit reported that concurrent scrapes surface a raw, unclassified `Request failed with status code 429` bypassing the error envelope. Reproducing the exact path (the result-poll `axios.get` throwing a 429) shows: `novada_scrape` *does* rewrap the AxiosError into a plain `Error` (by design), but the `429` substring survives, and `classifyError()` — which `dispatch()` applies to **every** thrown error at the MCP boundary regardless of type — still classifies it as `RATE_LIMITED` (failure_class:quota + `retry_after_ms` + reduce-concurrency guidance). No raw string reaches the agent. Locked in with a test; no code change needed. (Backend extractor outages and the static-catalog health gap surfaced by the same audit remain tracked as TOW2-305 — a Novada backend issue, not fixable in this wrapper.)
- Full suite **1864 tests / 115 files** green, `tsc --noEmit` clean. New prove-the-tester regression tests cover markdown/plain passthrough AND HTML-mislabeled-as-`text/plain` on *both* the `extract` and `site_copy` paths (each verified to fail against the pre-fix code). Independent `code-reviewer` pass on the diff — not the author's own review.

---

## [0.9.31] — 2026-07-21

Reliability + honesty patch. Shipped after an independent external audit (found issues → fix-loop → re-audit CLEAN). No new tools — this hardens what's there. Backend extractor outages surfaced during the audit (github/x/yandex/bing/youtube) are tracked separately as a Novada backend issue (TOW2-305), not fixable in this wrapper.

### Fixed
- **YouTube wrong-target guard (data integrity).** `novada_scrape_youtube` video-metadata ops (`video_by_url`, `video_by_id`) now verify the returned video id matches the requested one. A mismatch returns a dedicated `WRONG_TARGET` error (permanent, non-retryable, and — unlike the old path — surfaced to alerting) instead of silently presenting a different video as `success`. Scoped to metadata ops and matched on identity fields only (id/url), so it never false-rejects a valid result. Fixes an audited case where a request for one video returned another as success.
- **Honest backend-failure copy.** When a scraper's backend fails, the tool now states the data source is temporarily unavailable / under maintenance on Novada's side — not the caller's request, parameters, or key — and points to `novada_extract` as an alternative, instead of the misleading "wait 30s and retry / contact support."
- **`server.json` generated from the registry at build.** It was shipping stale (v0.9.17, 11 tools, named removed tools `novada_unblock`/`novada_health`, "4 engines incl. Bing"). Now `scripts/gen-server-json.mjs` derives `version`, `packages[].version`, `tools`, and the summary description from `package.json` + the tool registry; a CI guard (`server-json-sync.test.ts`) fails the build on any drift (incl. the install-target `packages[].version`).
- **Self-report consistency.** `novada_search` is correctly documented as 3 engines (Google, DuckDuckGo, Yandex) across registry/resources/CLI/prompts — Bing is a scrape platform, not a search engine. The README hidden-tools rationale now names the actual 8 hosted-hidden tools. `novada_research`'s field descriptions state that either `question` or `query` is required.

### Changed (docs, since 0.9.30)
- Linked free-credits banner + "how to choose a tool" decision map in both READMEs; trimmed both to a compact core-tools table (Bright Data–style progressive disclosure) with the full 38-tool reference moved to `docs/TOOLS.md`; added a top-of-README differentiator hook and an "honest tool surface" point to "Why Novada."

---

## [0.9.30] — 2026-07-20

Tools v2: the scraper surface grows from one generic tool to a curated per-platform family, and the hosted gateway's tool list is now mechanically derived from the same registry instead of hand-maintained. Shipped after a full 7-phase test-engineering audit (BLOCKED → fixed → re-audit CLEAN): preflight now enforces backend-required params, hosted hidden-tool gate is fail-closed. Known upstream issue: `novada_scrape_yandex` intermittently fails at the Novada backend (escalated).

### Added
- **15 dedicated per-platform scraper tools** (`novada_scrape_amazon`, `_google`, `_bing`, `_duckduckgo`, `_yandex`, `_youtube`, `_instagram`, `_facebook`, `_tiktok`, `_x`, `_walmart`, `_shein`, `_linkedin`, `_github`, `_perplexity`) alongside the existing generic `novada_scrape`. Each exposes a closed, typed `operation` enum scoped to that platform's verified-working operations only — no cross-platform operation guessing, no 11008 (invalid platform) errors. ChatGPT has no dedicated tool: both of its catalog operations are backend-dead. Curated tool count: **23 → 38**.
- **Config-driven factory for platform scrapers** (`src/tools/platform_scraper.ts`): `createPlatformScraperTool(config)` takes one declarative `PlatformScraperConfig` (platform domain, operation-name → catalog `scraper_id` map, description text) and generates the tool definition, registry entry, Zod schema, and handler in one call. Adding a platform is one new config file (see `src/tools/scrape_amazon.ts` for the reference) — `core.ts` and `registry.ts` never need to change again per platform. All 15 tools aggregate through `src/tools/platform_scrapers.ts`.
- **Catalog-cross-check guard**: a test asserts every `scraper_id` referenced by a platform-scraper config actually exists in `src/data/scraper_catalog.ts` (the single verified-operations source), so a typo'd or renamed operation id fails the build instead of surfacing as a live 11008/11008-class error.
- **Hosted surface now core-derived, not hand-curated.** `mcp.novada.com` computes its visible tool list as the npm package's registry (38) minus an explicit `HOSTED_HIDDEN` exclusion set (8 tools that don't apply to a stateless serverless endpoint: write-gated account mutations, per-process debug state, `novada_browser_flow`) — instead of maintaining a second hand-written tool list that can silently drift. Hosted-visible count: **15 → 30**.

### Testing
This adds tools (curated **23 → 38**, hosted **15 → 30**), so the standard net ran on every one of the 6 commits in this line, plus the extra checks that specifically come with adding tools — same gates every release, nothing skipped because this batch was large:
- **Full net, every commit:** vitest green throughout (climbed 1700 → 1714 → 1742 → 1775 → 1825 → **1826 tests**, 110 files, as tools/guards were added — never regressed), `tsc --noEmit` (lint) clean, and the v8-provider coverage ratchet gate passing (global thresholds set below the measured baseline; only ever raised, never lowered, to make a red run green).
- **Hosted drift guard** (`scripts/check-hosted-drift.mjs`, **7 gates**): derivation (`mcp.ts`'s `TOOLS` is provably built from core's `CORE_TOOLS`, not a hand-curated literal), a runtime-filter-presence gate, an anti-mutation gate, and 4 name-set checks (registry vs. `config/surfaces.json` vs. the live `HOSTED_HIDDEN` set vs. the pinned `hosted-15` eval fixture). Re-hardened mid-line after review caught the 2026-07-20 rewrite silently dropping the mutation gate; fault-injection proven before merge.
- **Catalog-cross-check guard** (`tests/tools/platform-scraper-catalog.test.ts`) — new this line: asserts every platform-scraper config's `operation` resolves to a real, `status:"ok"` slug in `src/data/scraper_catalog.ts`, generically across the whole `PLATFORM_SCRAPER_TOOLS` family (no platform hardcoded), so a typo'd or `backend_broken` slug fails CI instead of shipping. Proven non-inert via synthetic-fixture self-checks (typo'd slug / backend_broken slug / unknown-platform config each correctly fail; a valid op correctly passes).
- **Eval harness (Layer 5, tool selection):** Tier-A — the deterministic, zero-cost bag-of-words regression sentinel — ran on every batch, gated against a committed baseline (`eval/baseline-tier-a.json`). Exact-match accuracy is tracked honestly across the whole line as harder, more specific tools were added (50% → 55% → 46.7% → 60% → 68%, 17/25 tasks at the final 38-tool count): the two dips are documented, expected friction from a crude lexical-overlap heuristic meeting longer descriptions, not regressions — zero previously-passing task ever flipped to failing, and the forbidden-hit set never grew unexpectedly. Tier-B — a blind, real-model-in-the-loop selection test at the full 38-tool scale (`eval/model-eval-runner.mjs`'s harness; the run itself used a fresh Sonnet agent given only the 38 tool descriptions — name + full text, exactly what an MCP client sees — plus 35 requests with every task-ID/hint stripped: the 25-task eval set + 10 adversarial prompts hand-authored to hit the known confusion zones) scored **34/35 by the strict key, 35/35 effective**: the one nominal "miss" (a Shopify-storefront request — no dedicated tool exists for it) picked `novada_extract`, and on review the agent was right and the eval key was wrong (`novada_scrape` can't handle Shopify either — it isn't one of the 16 catalog platforms). Every one of the 15 platform-specific prompts routed to its exact tool, and every documented cross-tool disambiguation (search-answer vs. raw-SERP vs. single-URL vs. brand-sentiment vs. change-over-time vs. claim-check) held. Full report: `reports/2026-07-20-tools-v2/2026-07-20-tools-v2-tier-b-selection.md`.
- **Live smoke against the real production API:** the catalog → wire-format mapping was validated against the live `scraper.novada.com/request` endpoint (owner's key, read from the environment only, deleted after the run) across **8 platforms, one per category, zero errors** — Google (`google_search`, inline SERP), Amazon/Walmart/LinkedIn/YouTube/TikTok/GitHub (task-based: `code:200` + `task_id`), Perplexity (inline HTML, ~75s) — no `11006`/`10001`/auth failures on any call. Plus a real end-to-end run through `dispatch()` on the fresh build: `novada_scrape_google` returned a formatted 9-record result in 3.2s; `novada_scrape_amazon` returned the correct `status:"processing"` + `task_id` + re-poll hint in 47.6s — both the inline and async/polling code paths confirmed correct on the first call. Full report: `reports/2026-07-20-tools-v2/2026-07-20-tools-v2-live-validation.md`.
- **Review, every phase:** an independent verifier plus a `code-reviewer` pass on each of the 6 commits — never the author reviewing their own diff (see `reports/2026-07-20-tools-v2/2026-07-20-tools-v2-verify-amazon-scaffold.md` and `...-verify-hosted-exposure.md` for two of the full independent-verification writeups, each with every command actually re-run rather than taken on faith). The hosted derive-from-core refactor got the deepest scrutiny: dual review (independent verifier + code-reviewer) caught **2 HIGH-severity bugs** (a direct-call regression and a `?tools=` validation gap introduced by the derivation) before they were fixed and re-confirmed green, pre-merge.
- **Docs/count guards** (because this release adds tools, not just changes behavior): `discover.test.ts` and a new root-README guard assert the 23→38/15→30 counts everywhere a customer or agent looks first (root `README.md`, both `README.md`s, `novada-agent`/`novada-scrape` `SKILL.md`, `--help`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`) — closing a gap where only `npm-package/README.md` was previously guarded and the root README could silently drift; the collision-matrix baseline was re-recorded, and one new eval task was added per new platform tool (T11–T25).

### Notes
- **The preflight OR/AND bug — caught by scaffold-first, before it could replicate.** The shared scrape preflight originally treated every operation's required catalog params as OR-alternates (any one satisfies the check) — correct for search-engine alias keys (`q`/`keyword`/`query` are the same thing) but wrong wherever multiple params are independently mandatory (Amazon's `keyword` **and** `domain`, for example). Building the very first platform tool (`novada_scrape_amazon`, the deliberate Option-B scaffold) surfaced this immediately, before the pattern had a chance to spread. The fix is a hand-verified `AND_REQUIRED_OPS` allowlist in `src/tools/scrape.ts` (`mode:"all"` vs. `mode:"any"`), extended op-by-op only after checking real evidence — a catalog `dflt` value is a UI placeholder, not proof of a backend-side optional default (`google_comment_url` was deliberately left as OR because an existing test proves the backend accepts a partial call). Fixing the mechanism once, before scaffolding, meant the other 14 platforms only needed a config entry when they hit an AND-required op — not a 15x repeat of the same bug hunt.
- **The hosted derive-from-core refactor killed a hand-curated duplicate.** Before this line, `mcp.novada.com`'s tool list was a second, hand-maintained literal in `hosted-server/vercel/api/mcp.ts` — a second source of truth that could (and historically did) silently drift from the npm registry. It is now `CORE_TOOLS.map(...)`, filtered by the explicit `HOSTED_HIDDEN` exclusion set — adding a platform now requires zero hosted-side edits, ever.
- **ChatGPT has no dedicated tool.** Both of its catalog operations are `backend_broken` (the submit step hangs past 120s) — there is nothing verified to expose, so `novada_scrape_chatgpt` was deliberately not created rather than shipping an always-failing enum.
- **Generic `novada_scrape` is now largely redundant.** With 15 platform-specific tools covering the same ground behind tighter, closed enums, the generic tool's main remaining job is the platforms that don't have a dedicated tool yet — worth a deprecation-or-redirect look in a future release; not decided here.
- These are the same gates run for every release in this changelog — full net + lint + coverage, hosted drift guard, catalog-cross-check when tools are added, eval gate, independent review — not a one-off audit assembled for this line.

## [0.9.28] — 2026-07-14

Behavior telemetry with radical transparency: the hosted gateway now records usage metadata — and discloses exactly what, in-band.

### Added
- **Usage telemetry (hosted gateway only).** One event per tool call: tool name, parameter NAMES (never values), outcome code, latency, plan, quota state, client info from the handshake, serving region. For URL-taking tools, the target HOSTNAME only — never the path, query string, port, credentials, or fragment. Search queries are not collected at all. Emitted after the response (zero added latency), fail-open (telemetry can never fail a request), and disabled entirely unless configured.
- **`novada://privacy` resource** — the full field-by-field disclosure of what is and is not logged, readable in-band by any agent. `novada_setup` now points to it. The local npm server (`npx novada-mcp`) sends no telemetry; the disclosure says so.
- Aggregated, k-anonymized (≥3 distinct customers) weekly domain-demand statistics power tool/parser prioritization — individual customer targets are never identifiable.

## [0.9.27] — 2026-07-14

Truthfulness release: every state the server reports about itself now equals reality — or says `unknown`. No interface changes; no new required parameters.

### Fixed
- **`server_version` frozen at 0.9.3.** `novada_setup`/`novada_discover` reported a stale constant while the real server ran 0.9.26. All version surfaces now read ONE canonical source and always equal `serverInfo.version` — enforced by a deploy-gate contract test, so it can never silently drift again.
- **Lying-zero prices (`novada_scrape`).** `initial_price: 0` / `buybox_prices.final_price: 0` / `unit_price: ""` while a real price existed in the same record → unknown values are now `null`, and buybox `final_price` is reconciled from the record's trustworthy price when derivable. Genuine prices are untouched.
- **Error 11006 disambiguated.** One upstream code meant both "unknown operation id" and "product not activated". Now: `unknown_operation` (rejected before dispatch, free, valid operations listed) vs `not_activated` (points to dashboard activation).
- **Ghost resource.** Tool descriptions told agents to read `novada://scraper-platforms`, but hosted `resources/read` returned -32601. The hosted server now implements the full MCP resources capability (5 resources); unknown URIs return proper JSON-RPC errors.

### Added
- **A truthful status line on every hosted response:** free plan "N/1000 free calls remaining", paid accounts "uncapped (paid account)", meta tools "free call — no quota consumed". Cost is reported as explicitly `unknown` (no per-call billing signal exists upstream) — never a fabricated number.
- **`novada_health` `probe:true`** — performs ONE real minimal render through your key (billed, and disclosed as such) and reports the observed result. Default health output now states clearly it reflects entitlement status only, not live render capability.
- **Response-level warnings for silent no-ops:** `country` on `novada_browser` and `novada_proxy type=isp` is accepted but not applied — responses now say so instead of letting agents assume geo-routing happened.
- **Deploy-gate contract test** (`hosted-server/scripts/contract/`): 6 report-vs-reality invariants (version agreement, no silent no-op, no lying zero, advertised capability resolves, cost visibility, health truth) run on every deploy; drift fails the deploy before customers see it.

---

## [0.9.26] — 2026-07-13

Hosted gateway: paying accounts are no longer blocked by the free monthly cap (P0), and meta tools now work in every state.

### Fixed
- **Paid-tier cap exemption (P0, hosted).** The hosted gateway's 1000 calls/month free cap blocked every caller once exhausted — including paying customers whose calls bill their own Novada balance. The gateway now resolves account standing lazily at the cap boundary: accounts with real payment history (any successful order where `pay_money − coupon_money > 0`) or a positive balance pass beyond the cap; trial/coupon-only accounts remain capped. Zero checks and zero added latency below the cap; plan cached in KV (pro 30d / free 6h), dual-keyed by token hash and account uid so multi-key accounts share one resolution; fail-safe defaults to prior behavior if the upstream lookup is unavailable.
- **Meta tools never blocked (hosted).** `novada_discover`, `novada_account` (and its aliases), and `novada_setup` no longer consume quota and keep working even when a key is over the cap — a blocked user can always self-diagnose. Previously even `novada_discover` returned the cap error.
- **Cap error message tells the truth.** It now states the actual block condition (no payment history and no remaining balance) and the fastest unblock path: a top-up takes effect on the next call (live balance check); purchase-history classification applies within ~6 hours. Previously it claimed the cap was "independent of your Novada balance," which is no longer true.
- Stale "5000 calls/month free" copy corrected to 1000 in `DIRECTORIES.md` (both occurrences).

### Changed
- Hosted cap enforcement extracted to a pure, unit-testable module (`_plan.ts`: `classifyPlanFromUsageRecord`, `enforceGatewayCap`); 42 new tests (hosted suite now 52). npm package tool code unchanged — this release aligns versions with the hosted deploy.

---

## [0.9.25] — 2026-07-13

Scraper catalog rebuilt from a single verified source (16 platforms / 87 operations, each live-tested), a scrape format-routing bug fixed, geo-targeted extraction, and sharper agent guidance for depth and cost.

### Added
- **`novada_extract` `country` parameter.** Pass `country="de"` (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2) to route a render/unblocker fetch through an exit IP in that country — for localized pricing, geo-restricted content, and per-country monitoring (e.g. comparing a product price across European countries). Live-verified: `de` → German exit IP, `us` → US exit IP. Render-only (no effect on a pure static fetch); in batch mode the same country applies to all URLs.
- **`novada_discover` `platform` parameter.** A free call — `novada_discover({platform:"amazon.com"})` returns that platform's operations, required params, format, and status, so an agent can find the exact `scraper_id` without guessing (a wrong guess is a billed failure).
- **Single-source scraper catalog** (`src/data/scraper_catalog.ts`): 16 platforms / 87 operations, each with slug, param schema, wire format, and live-verified status — the authoritative source the tool descriptions, resource, and preflight all derive from.

### Fixed
- **`novada_scrape` format routing (bug).** Format (flat params vs `scraper_params` JSON) is now decided per-operation, not per-platform. This fixes 6 Google operations (Maps details ×4, comment, shopping) that previously failed through the MCP because they were sent flat params but require the JSON format.
- **Known-broken operations are now flagged on every failure path**, not only on success — 8 operations with confirmed backend issues (3 Amazon global-product, 3 SHEIN products, 2 ChatGPT) surface a clear "known backend issue (verified 2026-07-13)" note instead of a bare timeout.
- **`novada_extract` no longer suggests a backend-broken scrape operation** in its upgrade hints.

### Changed
- **Honest platform accounting:** the tool surface now states 16 implemented platforms / 87 operations (the dashboard lists ~107, but 91 are pre-registered shells with no backend and return 11006 — documented in the `novada://scraper-platforms` resource).
- **Agent guidance (skills):** `novada_search` returns snippets only — the skill now requires escalating to `novada_extract` (read the page) or `novada_research` (reads full sources) before answering an accuracy- or recency-sensitive question, with an explicit `search → extract → research` ladder. Cost guidance added: one `novada_research` call beats N manual search+extract; transient errors are auto-retried server-side, so do not manually re-fire (avoids double-charging).
- New `novada-proxy` and `novada-site-copy` skills; `novada-agent` skill corrected (23 tools; `bing` removed from the advertised search engines — it is not in the supported set).

### Known issues (backend — reported to Novada)
- 8 operations fail backend-side (see above); the download endpoint rate-limits (429) under rapid polling; `novada_browser`'s `country` param is accepted but not yet geo-routed (honest warning shown).

---

## [0.9.24] — 2026-07-10

`mcp.novada.com` is now a bare API endpoint (matching Bright Data / Firecrawl / Tavily), plus a quota-fairness fix and clearer price-field documentation.

### Changed
- **`mcp.novada.com` stripped to a pure MCP endpoint.** Removed the marketing mini-site (index/faq/pricing/tools/playground/chat/configure pages) that previously lived alongside the API — every path other than `/mcp` and `/:key/mcp` now returns a bare JSON pointer (`{name, endpoint, documentation_url}`) or a clean 404, matching how comparable MCP/API providers structure their endpoint subdomain. The marketing content's future home is `novada.com` (tracked separately — out of scope for this repo).

### Fixed
- **Hosted free-gateway quota is no longer charged on a degraded `novada_account` response.** When `novada_account` (and its composed sub-tools: wallet balance, usage, plans, traffic, capture logs, summary, health) gracefully degrades due to an upstream Novada API hiccup, the call is now refunded instead of silently consuming the customer's monthly quota for a response that didn't contain real data.
- **`novada_scrape` price-field reliability documented.** The tool description and `novada://scraper-platforms` resource now explain which Amazon price fields are trustworthy (`final_price`/`price`, check `_price_source`) versus frequently-zero-by-design (`initial_price`, `buybox_prices.final_price`) versus raw/unreliable upstream data (`buybox_prices.unit_price`) — previously this precedence only existed in code comments, invisible to callers.

---

## [0.9.23] — 2026-07-10

Static-ISP account reporting fixed to match how the product is actually billed, plus real upstream token verification on the hosted endpoint (with a KV cache to keep it fast).

### Fixed
- **Static-ISP no longer reports a bare 404.** `novada_account section="plans"` and `section="traffic"` were calling the flow-metered balance/traffic endpoints (`static_flow/balance`, `static_flow/consume_log`) for the static-ISP product — endpoints that structurally do not apply, since static-ISP is billed per-IP (open/renew/list), not by traffic volume. `plans` now reports static via `static_house/list` (active IP count, region breakdown); `traffic` now returns `applicable: false` with an explanation instead of a raw 404.
- **`traffic_daily` all-failed false positive:** requesting `products:["static"]` alone previously reported `all_failed: true` even though nothing failed, because the selected-product count was miscounted after static was removed from the flow fan-out. Fixed.

### Security (hosted)
- **`validateToken` now performs real upstream verification** against Novada's API instead of a format-only check (≥16 alphanumeric chars). Root cause: a misconfigured MCP connector was accepted with a token belonging to a different Novada account, and nothing flagged it because the server never confirmed the key was real. An explicit upstream rejection now returns 401 immediately, before any tool dispatch. A timeout or network error does not reject (fails open to the prior behavior) so hosted availability isn't coupled to upstream latency.
- **Verification result is cached (Vercel KV, 90s TTL, hashed key)** so this adds a real network call only on a token's first use per cache window — not on every single tool call. Failure/timeout outcomes are never cached.

---

## [0.9.22] — 2026-07-09

Caller-key billing fix (P0) — customers now consume against their own Novada API key on the hosted endpoint, never a fallback server key — plus an extract confidence-gate fix and a hosted timeout increase.

### Fixed
- **Caller-key billing (P0):** the hosted endpoint no longer falls back to a server-side `NOVADA_API_KEY` when a caller's token is absent — `stripServerConsumptionCreds()` deletes all server consumption credentials from the process environment at cold start, so there is no fallback target. A missing or invalid token now returns 401 and points to novada.com; every billable call is charged against the caller's own key.
- **`novada_extract` `fields` confidence gate:** the proximity-based field extractor could return a low-confidence value (e.g. picking a stray number out of unrelated prose) without flagging it. Extraction now applies a confidence floor — sub-floor values are returned as `value: null` with `low_confidence: true` and the original guess preserved as `low_confidence_value`, and are excluded from the extraction-quality count.
- **`novada_ip_whitelist` apiKey forwarding:** the tool now forwards the caller's own API key to the whitelist dispatch instead of relying on server defaults.
- **Hosted 56s wall-clock cap raised to 300s** (Vercel `maxDuration` 60→300) to reduce timeouts on slower operations; scrape tool guidance updated to recommend narrower params / `render=static` / the local server for still-slow jobs.

## [0.9.21] — 2026-07-08

Agent-first simplification: the visible tool surface was reduced from 33 to 23 tools derived from a single registry source, with all hidden tools still dispatchable. Accompanied by a honesty pass across engine lists, account card content, and param docs, plus live-caught card field fixes (TOW2-256).

### Changed
- **Surface consolidation (33 → 23 tools):** visible tools now derive from a single registry; 6 proxy variant tools and 4 scraper stub tools are hidden from the default surface but remain fully dispatchable via `NOVADA_TOOLS`. Eliminates routing confusion and duplicate discovery entries.
- **`novada_verify` restored to visible set:** owner decision — kept accessible on the default surface.
- **`agent_instruction` scope tightened:** only the 5 universal API-key errors carry `agent_instruction`; business-logic errors no longer emit it.

### Fixed
- **Account card live-caught:** usage card date/amount fields corrected to match the real API response shape; `plans[].expires_at` now populated instead of "—".
- **Bing removed from search engines:** `novada_search` no longer advertises Bing as an option; removed from every surface that still listed it (degraded backend, returns zero results).
- **`novada_account` honesty:** no invented currency in the account card; dead `mode` param removed.
- **`task_id` resume + browser snapshot documented:** `task_id` resume path and browser aria_snapshot usage documented in tool descriptions.
- **Date-param aliases:** `start_time`/`end_time` aliased consistently across account tools.
- **Dead `unblock.ts` removed** (had been accidentally resurrected; deleted again alongside its test).

### Docs
- Customer-facing README updated to reflect 23-tool surface; `novada_verify` re-added to catalog.

---

## [0.9.20] — 2026-07-07

Proxy account list clean-up and account identity line (TOW2-251, TOW2-252).

### Fixed
- **`novada_proxy_account_list` pure projection:** response no longer includes a lying `*_balance:0` blob from the raw API; only the intended fields are surfaced.
- **Account identity line:** the account card now shows which API key is in use (masked `...last4`) and the as-of timestamp, so agents can confirm they are operating under the right credential.
- **`apiKey` forwarding aligned:** `proxy_account_list` and `proxy_account_create` now forward the caller's `apiKey` to the developer API, consistent with all sibling tools.

---

## [0.9.19] — 2026-07-07

One-time first-run notice (TOW2-242).

### Added
- **First-run notice:** new users see a one-time message on first tool invocation — "$10 free credits at novada.com" — shown exactly once per install, then suppressed.

---

## [0.9.18] — 2026-07-07

Diagnostic fix campaign across scrape, account, and search tools (TOW2-236~241).

### Fixed
- **`novada_scrape` Amazon price:** real listing price now surfaced from product variations (was returning 0 when the main price field was absent); `unit_price` is no longer promoted to listing price.
- **`novada_scrape` availability:** `is_available` and `availability` fields reconciled — previously inconsistent across response shapes; negative availability strings handled correctly.
- **`novada_scrape` subcategory rank pollution:** `subcategory_rank` entries that leaked ASIN or BSR data into the field are filtered out; product `description` cleaned of trailing noise.
- **`novada_account` polymorphic balance:** the account card no longer renders "—" for plan balances on mobile or other non-standard balance shapes; balance field is resolved across all polymorphic response variants.
- **`novada_search` dangling feedback instruction:** `novada_search` no longer emits a trailing `novada_search_feedback` `agent_instruction` when the feedback tool is unreachable, preventing phantom tool calls.
- **Yahoo removed:** Yahoo is unsupported — removed from engine enum, schemas, docs, and all surfaces that still listed it.
- **P3 polish:** snippet whitespace and deduplication, extract Chrome UA, field separator consistency.

---

## [0.9.17] — 2026-07-05

Purity/consistency release: a 3-round "claim vs reality" audit (~20 review agents) aligned every agent-facing description, count, and example with what the code actually does. No behavior change except two additive group-key aliases.

### Fixed
- **`?groups=` portability:** the scrape tool-group key was `scraper` on npm but `scrape` on hosted — an agent carrying its `NOVADA_GROUPS` config across surfaces silently got zero scrape tools. Both keys now work on both surfaces.
- **Platform truth:** `novada_scrape` claims corrected from "129 platforms" to the real **13 platforms (~78 operations)**; removed phantom platforms (Reddit/Glassdoor/Zillow/Airbnb) from server.json, manifests, README, and the hosted playground preset (which errored 11006 on click).
- **Engine truth:** Yahoo is not supported — removed from every surface that still advertised it (registry/discover, hosted tools/list, resources, prompts, website EN+中文); `novada_search` = 4 engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Yandex).
- **README/SKILL examples:** fabricated scrape operation-ids replaced with real `PLATFORM_OPERATIONS` keys (each verified); `select_paths` examples fixed to glob arrays (were regex strings that fail).
- **Error-path honesty:** dead `novada_health_all()` recovery hints → `novada_account(section="summary")`; transient failures no longer misreported as permanent "not activated"; proxy success-path no longer echoes real username bytes; scrape 401/403 split.
- **Description sync:** research returns extractive cited source material (not a synthesized report); extract `format=html` cap documented as 100K (was "10K"); scrape lists all 6 accepted formats and notes json is wrapper-fenced; `novada_monitor` on hosted carries a session-scoped caveat; browser/proxy `country` documented as accepted-but-not-applied.
- **Site/billing copy:** removed fictional pricing claims; quota message now points to balance top-up; tool counts unified (hosted 15 / npm 22).

> Note: 0.9.4–0.9.16 entries are being backfilled; see git history in the interim.

## [0.9.3] — 2026-07-03

P0 "one API key, everywhere" + agent-first correctness pass (Loop 1→2→3: audit → adversarial test → fix → review), shipped to npm + hosted. A single `NOVADA_API_KEY` now unlocks Search, Scraper, Extract, Web Unblocker, and (locally) Browser — including on the hosted `mcp.novada.com` endpoint, where the caller's key is now threaded to every product instead of falling back to the server account.

### Fixed
- **Health probe false-negative (P0):** the Web Unblocker health probe sent `js_render:false`, which the backend answers with `code=5001` ("Internal Server Error"), mislabeling an *active* Web Unblocker as "not_activated". Proven by isolation test: same key, `js_render:false`→`5001`, `js_render:true`→`code=0` with data (encoding irrelevant). Probe now sends `js_render:true`, and only `code=5001` maps to "not_activated" (any other non-zero code surfaces as a real error). Fixes `novada_health` + `novada_health_all` (both the Extract/Web-Unblocker and Unblock rows); the proxy probe uses the auto-fetch-aware resolver.
- **Unified key on the hosted endpoint (P0):** Web Unblocker / Proxy / Browser now use the caller's per-request `NOVADA_API_KEY` (threaded via `getWebUnblockerKey`→`store.apiKey`, `resolveProxyCredentials(apiKey)`, `resolveBrowserWs(apiKey)`) instead of falling back to the server's env key; hosted dispatch is wrapped in `withCredentials({apiKey})` so store-reading resolvers see the caller key. Credential caches are now keyed by an API-key fingerprint (tenant-safe). Reconciled the duplicate `getWebUnblockerKey`. **Breaking:** a non-real / format-only token no longer silently rides the server credential — pass a real Novada API key.
- **Browser mode on serverless (P0):** `render="browser"` (and `auto` escalation) now fails fast with a clear, actionable error on the hosted (Vercel) endpoint instead of a raw Playwright `connectOverCDP` `AuthorizationError`; `auto` falls back to the Web Unblocker tier.
- **Stale-version shadow (P0):** all documented client configs now pin `novada-mcp@latest`, so a globally-installed old build can no longer silently shadow `npx`. Added a "staying on the latest version" troubleshooting note + a no-global-install convention.
- **Dead scraper-status route:** removed the `api-m.novada.com/v1/scraper/{task_id}` GET fallback (returned HTTP 404) and the now-orphaned `SCRAPER_STATUS_BASE` / `SCRAPERAPI_BASE` constants. A `not_found` for a just-submitted task now carries a propagation-aware retry hint instead of a definitive give-up.
- **Structured errors:** `novada_setup` / `novada_session_stats` no longer dump raw ZodError JSON on invalid params.

### Changed
- **Tool descriptions & routing (agent-first "right prompt → right tool"):** corrected `novada_scrape` formats (dropped `csv`/`html`/`xlsx` the schema rejects; documented `toon`); `novada_scraper_submit` no longer claims "any URL" (it is platform + operation only); `novada_ai_monitor` clarified as a domain-filtered web search (not a direct model query); `novada_discover` category legend corrected; `novada_verify` wording aligned. Sharpened "Best for / Not for" to disambiguate `extract` vs `unblock` vs `scrape` and `search` vs `research` vs `map` vs `crawl` vs `site_copy`.
- **Three previously-unwired tools are now usable:** `novada_scraper_task_mgmt`, `novada_static_ip_mgmt`, `novada_capture_apikey` were implemented but never registered — now wired into the tool surface (account group). `novada_capture_apikey` masks the returned key (`****last4`); the two management tools gate writes behind `confirm:true`.
- `novada_setup` env table now lists `NOVADA_WEB_UNBLOCKER_KEY` and notes a single `NOVADA_API_KEY` already covers it.

### Security
- Input hardening on the newly-wired management tools: regex/length constraints on task ids, region, IP list, and keyword params (untrusted-input rule).

---

## [0.9.2] — 2026-07-03

Round 3 Fix & Verify revamp — **shipped to npm + hosted on 2026-07-03**. Also: NOV-682 — over-long search queries are now truncated at a word boundary (with a `query_truncated` marker in all response paths) instead of throwing.

### Fixed
- **36 defects** across `crawl` (glob + dedup), `discover` (category gating), `extract` (credential redaction + `urls` alias + block-page detection), `fields` (description quality), `map` (sitemap honesty), `research` (synthesis), `search` (sentinel + time_range + JSON), `verify` (stance mitigation) — each independently verified and reviewed. Detail: Linear NOV-680.
- `monitor` improvements shipped as **preview** — deepest stable-hash layer pending an architecture decision (hash extract's structured `content`, not a parsed markdown blob).

### Process
- Internal test workflow: test repo reduced to `main` + `staging`; auto-mirror hook scoped; gated `promote-to-public.sh` release script. Detail: Linear NOV-684 / NOV-688.

---

## [0.9.1] — 2026-07-02

Availability, config-accuracy, and safety fixes (NOV-673/674 follow-up), plus a customer-docs consistency pass.

### Fixed
- **`novada_search` default-engine `-32001`**: two submit timeouts hard-coded to `60000` now use `TIMEOUTS.SEARCH_TOTAL_CEILING`, so the default engine no longer times out under the transport ceiling.
- **`novada_search` cache correctness**: cache key now includes `country` + `language` — geo/locale variants no longer collide on a shared cached result.
- **`novada_search` no-task_id path**: a raw `throw new Error(rawJSON)` is now `makeNovadaError(API_DOWN, …)`, so failures surface as a classified error carrying `agent_instruction`.
- **`novada_browser_flow` SSRF guard**: replaced a hand-rolled host regex with the shared `isBlockedHost` allowlist used elsewhere, closing a bypass gap.

### Changed
- **Error / health / setup wording**: dashboard link `dashboard.novada.com/overview/` (403) → `/api-key/` (200); `novada_health` not-activated line reworded with a real activation URL; `novada_setup` "Status: Ready" softened to avoid over-claiming.

### Docs
- Removed the non-existent `/sse` hosted route from every client guide (it 404s) — hosted auth is a **Bearer header or `?token=` on the same `/mcp` endpoint**.
- Version pins aligned to the published release; tool count corrected to **38** across all pages; `novada_unblock` documented as ungrouped (select via `NOVADA_TOOLS`).

---

## [0.9.0] — 2026-07-01

Consolidation release. Merges the red-team hardening campaign into a single version and supersedes the 0.8.5–0.8.10 line (NOV-578 series), which shipped to npm without individual changelog entries.

### Security / data-leak (Taxonomy B — NOV-674)
- **Path + PII redaction**: `/Users/…` and `/home/…` in any error/output → `[local-path]` (single-boundary `redactSecrets`).
- **Proxy username masking**: masked across url/env/curl formats × `novada_proxy` / `novada_proxy_static` / `novada_proxy_dedicated`; zone-suffixed usernames in error text → `[proxy-username]`; usage examples use a `<PROXY_USER>` placeholder.
- **Auth classification**: developer-API codes 401 / 11000 / 10002 → `INVALID_API_KEY` (failure_class=auth, retry_recommended=false) instead of a misleading not_found / invalid_params.
- **Input caps at the schema boundary**: query ≤ 500 chars, research question ≤ 2000, scraper payload ≤ 60 KB — rejected synchronously before any HTTP call.
- **`novada_unblock` timeout ceiling**: `Math.min(timeout, 120_000)` + `Promise.race` guard — no more transport `-32001`.
- **`novada_verify` injection rejection**: CRLF / null-byte / `javascript:` claims rejected; HTML sanitized so no false `supported` verdict.

### Schema-contract integrity (Taxonomy A — NOV-673)
- **`required[]` correctness**: defaulted params no longer appear in JSON-Schema `required[]` across ~25 tools (root-caused to Zod v4 `toJSONSchema()` verbatim passthrough).
- Removed false `additionalProperties:false`; removed `outputSchema` where no `structuredContent` was returned (fixes `-32600`); `idempotentHint:false` on `novada_monitor` / `novada_verify`.
- Global ZodError handler now emits `agent_instruction`.
- Deleted dead `mode` / `limit` crawl aliases (undocumented, no backend support).

### Fixed (NOV-662–666)
- outputSchema/structuredContent contract on search/extract/map/verify.
- `novada_scraper_status` / `novada_scraper_result`: propagation-aware `not_found` (checks task existence on the primary `!downloadUrl` branch + code 10000).

### Improved (NOV-668–672)
- **Kufer/webbasys availability**: detects CSS-sprite course status (skips `<a>` link text; keys on a recognized status keyword) — no more false "available" on `ausgebucht` courses.
- **German label-value tables**: 50-entry `GERMAN_LABEL_MAP` wired into infobox + label-value row extraction (Beginn/Status/Anmeldeschluss/…); table cell cap 200, `<dl>` cap 80.
- Batch `novada_extract` returns a compact inline summary; `truncatePreservingTable` keeps bottom-of-page tables intact; contextual `agent_instruction`.

### Fixed (FIX-5)
- `novada_health` / `novada_health_all`: env vars set-but-unprobed now render **"configured (not verified)"** (`configured_unverified` status) instead of a misleading **"active"**. Env-absent still shows "not configured".

### Process
- Fix / verify / orchestrator separation (never self-verify); 50 Sonnet-4.6 red-team agents → 165 findings → 2 taxonomies; 3 fix groups × 3 independent live-verify groups with real credentials.

---

## [0.8.4] — 2026-04-25 (pending review)

### Added
- **`novada://scraper-platforms` MCP resource**: Full catalog of 129 supported scraper platforms with operation IDs and required params. Agents can now discover which platform/operation to use without reading external docs. Covers 10 categories: e-commerce, search engines, social media, jobs, real estate, finance, reviews, tech, travel, news.
- **Browser action `aria_snapshot`**: Returns Playwright's accessibility tree as YAML — semantic role+name refs, ~70% smaller than raw HTML, stable selectors. Uses `page.ariaSnapshot()` (Playwright v1.46+ API). Better than `snapshot` for element discovery.
- **MCP Prompt `scrape_platform_data`**: Slash command guiding agents through platform/operation discovery → novada_scrape call → Error 11006 fallback workflow.
- **MCP Prompt `browser_stateful_workflow`**: Slash command guiding agents through aria_snapshot-first browser automation with session_id state management.

### Improved
- **`novada_browser` description**: Removed stale "no state persists" text (wrong since v0.8.2 added sessions). Now documents `session_id` usage, session TTL, and all available actions.
- **`novada_scrape` description**: References `novada://scraper-platforms` resource instead of external docs URL.
- **`novada_unblock` description**: Clarified distinction from `novada_extract(render="render")` — unblock returns raw HTML, extract returns cleaned text.
- **`novada://guide` resource**: Added Failure Recovery Patterns (4 scenarios with exact next steps) and Token Efficiency Tips (5 patterns for reducing token usage).
- **`operation` field in ScrapeParamsSchema**: Expanded from 3 to 8 example operation IDs, references `novada://scraper-platforms` resource.
- **`snapshot` action**: Added tip comment pointing to `aria_snapshot` as the preferred alternative.

### Tests
- 439 passing (was 366 in v0.8.3, +73 new tests)
- New: 2 aria_snapshot tests (`tests/tools/browser.test.ts`)
- New: 40 prompt tests (`tests/prompts/index.test.ts`) — all 5 prompts, optional args, error handling
- New: 31 resource tests (`tests/resources/index.test.ts`) — all 4 resources, content verification

---

## [0.8.3] — 2026-04-24

### Added
- **`novada_health` tool** (11th tool): instantly shows which Novada products are active on your API key. Runs parallel probes for Search, Web Unblocker, Scraper API, Proxy, and Browser API. Returns a markdown status table with activation links for anything not yet enabled — great for first-time setup and debugging.
- **Browser action `hover`**: hover over a CSS selector (triggers CSS hover states, dropdown menus, tooltips).
- **Browser action `press_key`**: press a keyboard key (Enter, Tab, Escape, ArrowDown, Space, etc.). Optional `selector` focuses an element first.
- **Browser action `select`**: select a value from a `<select>` dropdown by value or label text.

### Fixed
- **Scraper API error 11006 message**: replaced dead-end "Contact support@novada.com" with a direct self-serve activation link — `dashboard.novada.com/overview/scraper/` — so users can unblock themselves without waiting for support.

### Tests
- 366 passing (was 351 in v0.8.2, +15 new tests)
- New: 11 health tool tests (`tests/tools/health.test.ts`) — probes, masking, Next Steps section
- New: 4 browser action tests for hover, press\_key (with/without selector), select

---

## [0.8.2] — 2026-04-24

### Added
- **PDF extraction**: `novada_extract` now handles PDF URLs transparently — detects `Content-Type: application/pdf` and `.pdf` extension, extracts plain text + page count via pdf-parse. No new tool needed; works the same as HTML extraction.
- **Persistent browser sessions**: `novada_browser` now accepts a `session_id` parameter — reuse the same browser page (cookies, localStorage, login state) across multiple calls.
- **New browser actions**: `close_session` (explicitly release a named session) and `list_sessions` (see all active session IDs).
- **Session TTL**: Browser sessions expire after 10 minutes of inactivity with automatic cleanup on next access.
- **Claude plugin manifest**: `claude-plugin.json` created (local only, in .gitignore).
- **Token efficiency documentation**: `docs/TOKEN_EFFICIENCY.md` with benchmark table vs Bright Data (local only).
- **Quick Install section**: README.md now includes a Quick Install section for Claude Code.
- **PDF size cap**: PDFs larger than 10 MB are rejected with a helpful error message.

### Fixed
- **PDF detection in all fetch modes**: `extractSingle` previously only detected PDFs via `routeFetch`. Now also detects PDFs directly when `render="render"` or `render="static"` modes call `fetchWithRender`/`fetchViaProxy` directly.
- **PDF escalation guard**: Added `!html.startsWith("pdf_pages:")` guard to prevent unnecessary JS rendering escalation when PDF content is already extracted.
- **Browser mock missing `close` method**: `tests/tools/browser.test.ts` mock page now includes `close: vi.fn()` required by session cleanup.

### Tests
- 351 passing (was 326 in v0.8.1, +25 new tests)
- New: `tests/utils/pdf.test.ts` (13 tests — `isPdfResponse`, `extractPdf` size guard, mock-based text/metadata extraction)
- New: 8 session management tests in `tests/utils/browser.test.ts`
- New: 4 session tool tests in `tests/tools/browser.test.ts`

---

## [0.8.0] 2026-04-23

**10-tool MCP — full capability release.** Upgrades v0.6.7 (5 tools) to v0.8.0 (10 tools + smart routing + quality extraction).

### New Tools
- `novada_scrape` — structured data from 129 platforms via Scraper API
- `novada_proxy` — proxy connection strings (url/env/curl)
- `novada_verify` — fact-checking via multi-source search + evidence synthesis
- `novada_unblock` — forced JS render via Web Unblocker or Browser API CDP
- `novada_browser` — cloud browser automation via CDP (up to 20 chained actions)

### Smart Routing & Performance
- **Auto-escalation chain** — static → render → browser, with bot-challenge detection at each step
- **Race fetch** — Scraper API and direct fetch race in parallel; 866ms → 108ms latency
- **Domain registry** — 70-entry pre-routing table; known JS-heavy sites skip the static probe entirely
- **Session circuit breaker** — proxy availability cached per session

### Content Quality
- Content limit raised 8,000 → 25,000 chars with paragraph-boundary truncation
- Inline links (`[text](url)`), bold/italic/code preserved in markdown output
- Density scoring (simplified Mozilla Readability) for main content selection
- JSON-LD / schema.org structured data extraction (Product, Article, Event, Person, etc.)
- Bot challenge detection — Cloudflare, Akamai, Imperva signal coverage
- Extraction quality score 0–100 exposed as `quality:N` in metadata

### Field-Targeted Extraction
- `fields` param on `novada_extract` — `["price", "author", "rating"]` → `## Requested Fields` block
- Source priority: JSON-LD → regex patterns → key:value scan → not_found

### Tests
- 258 passing (was 66 in v0.5.0). Full unit coverage across all 10 tools + utilities.

### Known Blockers (account-level)
- `novada_search`, `novada_research`, `novada_verify`: SERP backend needs activation
- `novada_scrape`: Error 11006 — Scraper API product not yet activated on this account

---

## [1.1.0] 2026-04-23

### Added
- **Domain registry** (`src/utils/domains.ts`) — 70-entry lookup table mapping known domains to optimal fetch method (static/render/browser). Eliminates auto-detection probe for known sites. `lookupDomain(url)` checks exact match → www-stripped → subdomain fallback.
  - Static: github.com, wikipedia.org, stackoverflow.com, news.ycombinator.com, docs.python.org, npmjs.com, arxiv.org, 20+ news/blog domains
  - Render: amazon.* (all regions), twitter/x.com, youtube.com, linkedin.com, tiktok.com, walmart.com, bestbuy.com, airbnb.com, imdb.com, 20+ e-commerce domains
  - Browser: booking.com, glassdoor.com, ticketmaster.com, stubhub.com (fingerprinting-heavy)
- **Integrated into `novada_extract`** — when `render: "auto"`, registry entry is used as `effectiveMode`. Known render/browser domains skip the static probe entirely.
- **Field-targeted extraction** (`src/utils/fields.ts`) — `fields` param on `novada_extract`. Pass `["price", "author", "rating"]`, get `## Requested Fields` block in output.
  - Source priority: JSON-LD structured data → regex pattern matching → generic `key: value` scan → not_found
  - Built-in patterns: price (5 currency formats), date, author ("By X"), rating (X/5, X stars), availability (in/out of stock)
  - Each result tagged with source: `*(from schema)*`, `*(pattern)*`, or `—` for not found
- **`fields` added to `ExtractParamsSchema`** (`src/tools/types.ts`) — optional, max 20 fields

### Tests
- 258 passing (was 240). +18: domains (10), fields (8).

---

## [1.0.1] 2026-04-23

### Performance
- **Race proxy+direct** (`src/utils/http.ts`) — `fetchViaProxy` now starts Scraper API and direct fetch simultaneously. Saves ~400ms per call when Scraper API returns 404. Session circuit breaker caches result. Benchmark: 866ms → 108ms.

### Content Quality
- **Content limit** — `extractMainContent` raised from 8,000 → 25,000 chars. Paragraph-boundary truncation replaces mid-sentence cut.
- **Inline links** — `<a href>` now rendered as `[text](url)` in markdown body. Wikipedia: 0 → 165 inline links.
- **Bold/italic** — `<strong>/<b>` → `**text**`, `<em>/<i>` → `*italic*`, `<code>` → backtick inline.
- **Boilerplate removal** — table-layout nav selectors + `td[bgcolor]` cell removal. HN nav leak fixed.
- **`extractMainContent` accepts `baseUrl`** — inline links resolve to absolute URLs.

### Added — Content Intelligence
- **Density scoring** (`scoreCandidateElement`) — simplified Mozilla Readability algorithm in Cheerio. Scores `div/section/article/main` by `text_len × (1 - link_density) + heading_bonus + para_bonus`. Used as fallback when CSS selectors miss.
- **JSON-LD extraction** (`extractStructuredData`) — parses `<script type="application/ld+json">`. Supports Product (price, brand, rating, availability), Article/NewsArticle (headline, author, datePublished), Event, Person, Organization, WebPage. Priority-ordered by schema type.
- **Bot challenge detection** (`detectBotChallenge`) — Cloudflare (just a moment, cf-browser-verification, __cf_chl_opt), Akamai (_abck, bm_sz), Imperva (incap_ses), heuristic signals (tiny body + blank title). Auto-escalates to browser in `novada_extract`.
- **Extraction quality score** (`scoreExtraction`) — 0–100 per extraction. Factors: structured data (+30), content length, link density, headings, code blocks, render mode, bot challenge penalty. Exposed as `quality:N` in metadata line.
- **Structured data block** — `## Structured Data` section prepended to extract output when JSON-LD found.

### Tests
- 240 passing (was 222). +18 new: JSON-LD (7), density scoring (2), bot challenge (6), quality score (3).

---

## [1.0.0] 2026-04-23

### Added — Full 10-tool MCP
Merged `feature/full-capability-sdk`. Upgraded from v0.7.0 (5 tools) to v1.0.0 (10 tools).

**New tools:**
- `novada_scrape` — structured data from 129 platforms via Scraper API. Outputs: markdown/json/csv/html/xlsx.
- `novada_proxy` — proxy connection strings in url/env/curl format. Country, city, session_id targeting.
- `novada_verify` — fact-checking via multi-source search + evidence synthesis.
- `novada_unblock` — forced JS render via Web Unblocker or Browser API CDP. 50K char truncation.
- `novada_browser` — cloud browser automation via CDP (Playwright). Up to 20 chained actions: navigate, click, type, screenshot, snapshot, evaluate, wait, scroll.

**Smart routing** (`src/utils/router.ts`): static → render → browser auto-escalation. Cost metadata: low/medium/high per call.

**SDK export** (`src/sdk/index.ts`): `NovadaClient` class with typed methods for all 10 tools.

### Known Blockers (account-level, not code bugs)
- `novada_search`, `novada_research`, `novada_verify`: `scraper.novada.com/search` returns 404 — backend needs sync search endpoint.
- `novada_scrape`: Error 11006 — Scraper API product not activated on this account.

## [0.6.7] — 2026-04-20

### Added
- **Smart routing** in `novada_extract` and `novada_crawl`: auto-escalates from static → render (Web Unblocker) → Browser API when JS-heavy content detected
- **`novada_proxy` tool** (6th tool): returns proxy credentials in `url`, `env`, or `curl` format for use in HTTP clients
- **Browser API** via `playwright-core`: set `NOVADA_BROWSER_WS=wss://...` to enable full CDP-controlled browser rendering
- **Research source extraction**: `novada_research` now fetches top 3 sources in full — not just snippets
- **TypeScript SDK**: `NovadaClient` class exported from `novada-search/sdk` with typed methods
- **`render` param** on `novada_extract` and `novada_crawl`: `auto` (default), `static`, `render`, `browser`
- **Multi-credential support**: `NOVADA_BROWSER_WS`, `NOVADA_PROXY_USER/PASS/ENDPOINT` env vars
- **nova CLI**: `proxy` subcommand + `--render` flag on extract/crawl

### Fixed
- `novada_extract` / `novada_crawl` now detect and handle JS-heavy sites (Cloudflare, SPAs, React apps) instead of silently returning empty shells
- `novada_research` now returns actual source content, not just URL snippets

### Changed
- All tool descriptions updated for agent-optimal clarity (problem-first, not product-first)

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- **novada_map** tool — fast URL discovery via BFS crawl without content extraction. Filter results by search term.
- **Zod validation** — all tool parameters validated with Zod schemas. Clear error messages for invalid inputs.
- **cheerio HTML parsing** — replaced regex-based HTML extraction with cheerio for reliable content extraction from complex pages.
- **Structured error classification** — errors categorized as INVALID_API_KEY, RATE_LIMITED, URL_UNREACHABLE, API_DOWN with retry guidance.
- **Rich tool descriptions** — each tool now includes "Best for", "Not recommended for", "Common mistakes", usage examples, and return descriptions.
- **cleanParams utility** — removes empty values before API calls.
- **extractLinks function** — cheerio-based link extraction with deduplication and relative URL resolution.
- **CHANGELOG.md** and **.env.example** files.
- 51 new tests (117 total, up from 66).
- **Tool function tests** — mocked axios tests for novadaSearch, novadaExtract, novadaResearch covering success, error, and edge case paths.
- **URL scheme validation** — only HTTP/HTTPS URLs accepted. Blocks file://, ftp://, localhost, and RFC 1918 private IP ranges (SSRF protection).
- **Input schemas generated from Zod** — tool inputSchema now auto-generated via zod-to-json-schema, eliminating schema drift.
- **Failure reporting** — research tool now reports failed search count in output.

### Changed
- Tool descriptions rewritten to follow Firecrawl pattern with agent guidance.
- Validation errors now return Zod's structured error messages instead of generic strings.
- HTML content extraction now handles tables, blockquotes, and code blocks correctly.
- Error responses include error code, retry guidance, and documentation URL.
- SIGINT handler for graceful shutdown.
- Proxy fallback now logs a warning when falling back to direct fetch.
- HTML content selector threshold raised from 100 to 200 chars (reduces false matches).
- HTML truncation for `format: "html"` now cuts at tag boundaries instead of mid-tag.
- Relative URL resolution now uses `new URL(href, base)` for all path types.

### Fixed
- **SECURITY**: Upgraded axios to >= 1.15.0 to patch critical SSRF vulnerability (GHSA-3p68-rc4w-qgx5).
- **SECURITY**: API keys stripped from all error messages via `sanitizeMessage()` — prevents credential leaks in error responses.
- **SECURITY**: Proxy 401/403 errors no longer silently swallowed — auth failures are now re-thrown instead of falling back to direct fetch.
- HTML parser no longer fails on deeply nested divs or encoded entities.
- Link extraction now handles relative URLs and protocol-relative URLs (`//`) correctly.
- Table cell content no longer duplicated in markdown output.
- Map tool seed URL now normalized in dedup set (prevents duplicate seed in output).
- Map and crawl tools now filter discovered links through `isContentLink` (skip assets, auth pages).
- cleanParams utility now actually wired into search tool (was previously dead code).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added
- Initial release with novada_search, novada_extract, novada_crawl, novada_research tools.
- Proxy infrastructure integration (100M+ IPs, 195 countries).
- Multi-engine search (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Yahoo, Yandex).
- BFS/DFS crawling with concurrent page fetching.
- Exponential backoff retry logic.
- 66 unit tests.
