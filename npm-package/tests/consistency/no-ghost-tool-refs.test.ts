/**
 * No-ghost-tool-refs guard.
 *
 * NOV-847: Novada's own agent-facing guidance (MCP resources + prompts) recommended
 * tool names that were HIDDEN from ListTools by the TOW2-256 registry refactor —
 * e.g. `novada_proxy_residential`, `novada_scraper_submit`, `novada_unblock`,
 * `novada_health`. An agent that trusted the guide and called one of those names
 * got rejected by its own MCP client (the name was never in ListTools) — the
 * literal root cause behind "the agent is always confused."
 *
 * This test scans the RENDERED TEXT of every piece of agent-facing guidance —
 * the novada://guide and novada://llms-txt resources (plus every resource's
 * catalog description), every prompt in prompts/index.ts (list description
 * + fully-rendered getPrompt() output), and the top-level README.md — for
 * tokens matching /novada_[a-z0-9_]+/, and asserts each one names a tool that
 * is ACTUALLY present in REGISTERED_TOOL_NAMES (src/tools/registry.ts — the
 * same source of truth tests/tools/discover.test.ts guards against ListTools
 * drift).
 *
 * A token that matches the pattern but isn't in the registry is a "ghost":
 * guidance steering an agent toward a tool call its client will reject.
 *
 * This is a PERMANENT CI gate, not a one-time cleanup — any future edit to
 * resources/index.ts, prompts/index.ts, or README.md that reintroduces,
 * renames-without-updating, or typos a tool name fails this test immediately,
 * turning "keep guidance in sync" from discipline into structure. The README
 * case was added after a README rewrite drifted from the registry and was
 * only caught by hand — this closes that gap permanently.
 *
 * Not-inert proof (performed manually, not re-run here since it requires
 * mutating source):
 * - NOV-847 (resources): temporarily reinserting the string "novada_unblock"
 *   into the novada://guide text made the
 *   "novada://guide references only registered tools" test below fail with a
 *   clear ghost-token message; removing it restored green. See the NOV-847
 *   worklog for the exact diff used.
 * - README case: temporarily appending "Call `novada_ghost_tool()` for X." to
 *   README.md made the "README.md references only registered tools" test
 *   fail with `README.md references tool name(s) NOT in
 *   REGISTERED_TOOL_NAMES ...: novada_ghost_tool`; reverting the append
 *   restored green (see verification report for this change).
