/**
 * Discover catalog drift guards.
 *
 * The discover catalog is DERIVED from the canonical TOOL_REGISTRY (src/tools/registry.ts),
 * and the server's wired tool list lives in the `TOOLS` array exported by src/core.ts. These
 * tests fail loudly the moment any of those three drift apart:
 *
 *   1. TOOL_REGISTRY names === src/core.ts TOOLS names        (exact set — no ghosts, no omissions)
 *   2. Every registry entry has a valid category + status     (typed metadata integrity)
 *   3. The rendered discover catalog ⊆ TOOL_REGISTRY          (no ghost tools surface to agents)
 *   4. Category filtering returns exactly the registered tools for that category
 *
 * Why import src/core.ts's TOOLS directly (not text-parse it): core.ts documents itself as
 * side-effect-free and safe to import from any transport or test (no server construction, no
 * process.exit, no stdio boot — unlike src/index.ts, which boots a stdio server at module
 * top-level and must never be imported by a test). `TOOLS` is EXACTLY the wired ListTools
 * surface (`_TOOL_DEFINITIONS.filter(t => REGISTERED_TOOL_NAMES.has(t.name))`), so importing
 * it is both simpler and MORE robust than regex-scraping `_TOOL_DEFINITIONS` text: it stays
 * correct even when a tool definition is generated/spread in from another module (e.g.
 * tools/platform_scraper.ts's per-platform scraper factory) rather than written as a literal
 * `name: "novada_x"` string directly in core.ts. This mirrors the pattern already used by
 * tests/tools/collision-matrix.test.ts and tests/contract/nov673-schema-contract.test.ts.

 * definition that is GENERATED/spread in from another module (exactly what
