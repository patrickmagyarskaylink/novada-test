/**
 * baseline-selector.mjs — the FREE, always-on half of the Layer 5 (tool-selection)
 * eval harness. Ported from reports/phase1-net-design/B/prototype/baseline-selector.mjs
 * (already executed there against the live build, scoring 50%) — logic kept verbatim,
 * only the home and import paths changed to fit npm-package/eval/ (see README note
 * at the bottom of this header for why this directory).
 *
 * Deterministic, zero-dependency, zero-API-cost tool selector. Given a task prompt,
 * scores every tool in the REAL, currently-built TOOL_REGISTRY (imported live from
 * npm-package/build/tools/registry.js — never a hand-copied snapshot) by lexical
 * overlap between the prompt and the tool's short catalog description, and picks
 * the argmax.
 *
 * This is intentionally crude (bag-of-words overlap, no embeddings, no model call).
 * Its job is NOT to be a great tool-selector — it is to be a cheap, deterministic,
 * always-green-or-red REGRESSION SENTINEL that runs on every CI invocation for
 * $0 and 0 third-party-API calls, so a routing regression is caught even on
 * forks/PRs that have no ANTHROPIC_API_KEY configured. The model-in-the-loop
 * runner (model-eval-runner.mjs, same directory) is the higher-fidelity, real-cost
 * complement — built, but NEVER executed by this script or its CI job.
 *
 * A green run of THIS script means "no NEW description collision was introduced
 * since the recorded floor" — NOT "tool selection is correct." Read the accuracy
 * number as a regression floor, not a quality bar; see BASELINE_FLOOR below.
 *
 * Why npm-package/build/ (compiled JS) and not npm-package/src/ (TypeScript) here:
 * this file is a plain, dependency-free .mjs script in the same family as
 * tests/live/bing-reliability.mjs and tests/live/integration.mjs, which already
 * establish the repo's convention for standalone (non-vitest) CLI scripts: import
 * from build/, run with plain `node`, no tsx/ts-node, no new devDependency. The
 * CI workflow that invokes this script always runs `npm run build` first (same as
 * the existing ci.yml job), so build/ is guaranteed fresh at invocation time. The
 * companion regression gate at ../tests/eval/baseline-selector.test.ts imports the
 * SAME logic against src/tools/registry.ts directly (vitest transpiles TS on the
 * fly, no build needed) precisely so `npm test` never has a build-freshness
 * dependency — that file is the one that's truly wired into every single
 * `npm test` invocation; this file is the standalone reporting/CI-workflow tool.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run build && node eval/baseline-selector.mjs          # human-readable report
 *   npm run build && node eval/baseline-selector.mjs --json    # machine-readable output

/**
 * Recorded floor, not a quality bar: measured on 2026-07-19 against the live
 * 23-tool registry with this exact eval-tasks.json (v2, ported verbatim from
 * B's prototype apart from dropping the non-existent 'rapid' surface tag — see
 * eval-tasks.json's porting_notes). The prototype's own 2026-07-18 run against
 * v1 of this task set scored the same 50% (5/10) — the registry's relevant
 * descriptions did not change between the two runs. Update this constant
 * deliberately (with a comment + date) whenever the task set changes on purpose
 * or the registry's descriptions legitimately improve/regress — never let it
 * silently drift, and never lower it just to make a red run go green.
 *
 * 2026-07-20 UPDATE (Tools-v2 search-engine platform-scraper pass): eval-tasks.json
 * grew 11->15 tasks (T12-T15, one per new novada_scrape_<google|bing|duckduckgo|yandex>
 * tool). The crude Tier-A bag-of-words scorer gets 2 of the 4 new tasks wrong in a way
 * that adds NEW forbidden hits (T12, T13 both argmax to novada_search) — an honest,
 * expected consequence of harder/more-specific prompts, not a defect masked by lowering
 * this floor; see eval/baseline-tier-a.json's own dated comment for the full accounting.
 * Lowered 50%->46.67% (5/10->7/15) to match the honestly-regenerated committed snapshot.
 *
 * 2026-07-20 UPDATE 2 (Tools-v2 SOCIAL/VIDEO platform-scraper pass): eval-tasks.json
 * grew 15->20 tasks (T16-T20, one per new novada_scrape_<youtube|instagram|facebook|
 * tiktok|x> tool). Unlike the prior update, all 5 new tasks score correct:true — each
 * new platform's name/operation tokens are distinctive enough for Tier A's bag-of-words
 * argmax to pick cleanly, with no new forbidden hits; see eval/baseline-tier-a.json's own
 * dated comment for the full accounting. Raised 46.67%->60% (7/15->12/20) to match the
 * honestly-regenerated committed snapshot.
 *
 * 2026-07-20 UPDATE 3 (Tools-v2 FINAL platform-scraper pass): eval-tasks.json grew
 * 20->25 tasks (T21-T25, one per new novada_scrape_<walmart|shein|linkedin|github|
 * perplexity> tool). Same pattern as UPDATE 2 — all 5 new tasks score correct:true,
 * no new forbidden hits; see eval/baseline-tier-a.json's own dated comment for the
 * full accounting. Raised 60%->68% (12/20->17/25) to match the honestly-regenerated
 * committed snapshot.
 *
 * Kept for reporting/back-compat and as a human-readable summary of what
 * baseline-tier-a.json (below) records precisely, per-task. The actual gate
 * (FIX 2) no longer compares against this bare number — it compares against
 * the committed baseline-tier-a.json snapshot, which is exact (Tier A is fully
 * deterministic: no key, no network, no sampling) and catches per-task
 * identity regressions this scalar alone cannot (see evaluateRegressionGate).

 * byte-for-byte forever, not just as a scalar floor. Three independent
 * regression conditions, ALL must hold for the gate to pass:
 *
 *   1. exact_accuracy must not drop below the committed baseline's accuracy.
 *   2. No NEW forbidden-tool hit may appear — i.e. current.forbidden_hits must
 *      be a subset of baseline.forbidden_hits. Deliberately NOT gated on
 *      forbidden_hits.length === 0: the 2 hits recorded in baseline-tier-a.json
 *      (T03, T04) are expected weak-selector noise, not a defect to chase to
 *      zero — see that file's header. Only a NEW, previously-unseen forbidden
 *      hit is a regression signal.
 *   3. No task that was correct:true in the committed baseline may score

 *      accuracy could mask (e.g. one task breaking while another coincidentally
