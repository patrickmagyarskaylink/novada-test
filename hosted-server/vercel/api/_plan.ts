// ─── Approval-gate PREVIEW exemption (Layer 1.5, MEDIUM fix 2026-09) ────────
// ADVERSARIAL-INTEGRATION.md finding: the four WRITE tools gated behind
// evaluateApprovalGate() (npm-package/src/utils/approval.ts) each do a FIRST
// call with no `approval_token` that returns a `confirmation_required`
// PREVIEW — zero upstream API work, just an in-process HMAC sign (or an
// immediate rejection when a bare `confirm: true` is supplied with no prior
// token). Before this fix, enforceGatewayCap charged one quota unit for that
// preview AND one for the real EXECUTE call (valid approval_token) — one
// logical write cost 2 units, and a caller with exactly 1 unit left could get
// an approved-but-unexecutable write: preview succeeds (quota → 0), execute
// is then rejected by the cap with no refund path for the confirmation_required
// outcome (refundQuota only fires on the error/browser-flow paths, not here).
//
// Fix: detect the preview SHAPE (no non-empty approval_token) BEFORE
// enforceGatewayCap's decrementQuota call and skip charging — mirroring the
// existing CAP_EXEMPT_TOOLS early-return exactly (same allowed/charged/
// remaining/overCapAllowed shape, so buildStatusFooter's existing
// charged=false && !overCapAllowed branch — "gateway: free call — no quota
// consumed" — already renders correctly with zero new footer/telemetry
// branches). The matching EXECUTE call (valid approval_token) is NOT a
// preview and falls through to the normal charged path, so one logical write
// still costs exactly one quota unit.
//
// This is a CLASS table, not a single tool name, so any gated tool — including
// ip_whitelist/static_ip_mgmt/capture_apikey, all HOSTED_HIDDEN today but
// wired here uniformly in case that ever changes — is covered by adding one
// row, never a new branch at the call site. Three of the four tools are
// MULTI-action (only SOME `action` values go through evaluateApprovalGate —
// e.g. ip_whitelist's "list" never touches the gate and must still be
// charged normally), so the table also records which action values are
// gated. `actionParam: null` means the entire tool is a single gated write
// (proxy_account_create has no action discriminator).
//
// 2026-09-07: ip_whitelist's "remark" action was folded into the approval
// gate too (SEC-consistency fix, ledger-closure audit finding #4 — a WRITE
// action must not be reachable via a stateless flag while its siblings
// require a signed token) — see ip_whitelist.ts's evaluateApprovalGate(...,
// "ip_whitelist_remark") call site. Updated here to keep this table accurate
// to what the tool actually gates; ip_whitelist stays HOSTED_HIDDEN so this
// has no live hosted-behavior effect today, only correctness-of-record.
