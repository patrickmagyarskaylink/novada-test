/**
 * reconcile.ts — HQ outbox drain, triggered by a GitHub Actions scheduled workflow
 * (.github/workflows/reconcile-cron.yml) POSTing here every ~5-15 min.
 *
 * WHY GITHUB ACTIONS, NOT VERCEL CRON: this project runs on the Vercel HOBBY plan,
 * which does not support per-minute Vercel Cron (that needs Vercel Pro). Rather than
 * pay for an upgrade, this route is triggered externally over HTTP by GitHub Actions'
 * own scheduler at $0 — see reconcile-cron.yml's header comment for the full rationale
 * and the CADENCE CAVEAT (GitHub Actions' schedule trigger has a 5-minute floor and can
 * drift or skip a tick under load, so "~5-15 min" is typical, not guaranteed).
 *
 * WHY: HQ (api-m.novada.com) is the system of record for customer-facing MCP usage
 * logs; our telemetry Supabase is only a backup. The inline push (see _hq_push.ts,
 * scheduled in mcp.ts's waitUntil) drops a row after 3 immediate retries if HQ is
 * transiently unavailable — with no replay, those rows never reached HQ. This route is
 * that replay: on each trigger it re-sends the undelivered, attributable backlog, so
 * every recorded tool_call lands in HQ within roughly 5-15 minutes via the GitHub
 * Actions scheduler (upgrade to Vercel Pro for native per-minute cron) even across an
 * api-m outage — eventually 100%, nothing permanently dropped, regardless of exact
 * cadence, since the drainer retries the same backlog until it succeeds. Idempotent by
 * contract (HQ dedups on request_id+event_type), so re-sending an already-stored row is
 * a no-op on their side.
 *
 * SECURITY: refuses anything without `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET` (the GitHub
 * Actions workflow sends this explicitly, sourced from the `CRON_SECRET` repo secret —
 * which must be kept in sync with the same-named Vercel project env var this handler
 * reads) → no public trigger.
 *
 * READ KEY: SELECTing the backlog needs a read-capable key. The gateway's normal
 * TELEMETRY_SUPABASE_KEY is INSERT-only under RLS, so this route uses a separate
 * TELEMETRY_SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY, and passes it as TELEMETRY_SUPABASE_KEY into pushToHq
 * so its own push_status PATCH authenticates too.
