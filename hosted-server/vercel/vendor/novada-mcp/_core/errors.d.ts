/**
 * Review round 1 (2026-07-30, CRITICAL — live-verified over stdio, and LIVE in
 * prod on mcp.novada.com v0.9.32 today): every newline-handling pattern in this
 * file used to match ONLY `\r`/`\n` (`[\r\n]`). ECMA-262 (11.5) treats FOUR
 * characters as line terminators for `^`/`$` under a regex's `/m` flag: `\n`
 * (U+000A), `\r` (U+000D), U+2028 (LINE SEPARATOR), and U+2029 (PARAGRAPH
 * SEPARATOR). An attacker-controlled string containing a bare U+2028/U+2029
 * followed by `agent_instruction: "..."` sailed straight through every `[\r\n]`
 * pattern below unmodified — while this repo's OWN agent_instruction
 * extraction convention (`/^\s*agent_instruction\s*:\s*(.+)$/im`) DOES treat
 * U+2028/U+2029 as a line boundary in JS.
 *
 * WHO IS ACTUALLY EXPOSED (corrected 2026-07-30 by security review — an earlier
 * draft of this comment cited contract-test.py as a vulnerable consumer, which
 * is WRONG): Python's `re` under `(?im)` treats ONLY bare `\n` as a `^`/`$`
 * boundary — not `\r`, not U+2028/U+2029 — so contract-test.py was never at
 * risk from these variants, and our own harness therefore could not have caught
 * this. The exposed consumers are DOWNSTREAM JS/TS MCP clients (i.e. most real
 * agent runtimes, including the ones we ship this package for), which follow
 * ECMA-262 line-terminator semantics. Do not weaken this collapse on the
 * grounds that "our tests don't need it" — our tests are not the threat model.
 * Net effect: a forged "line" could masquerade as the FIRST line-anchored
 * agent_instruction match, ahead of the real one appended after it.
 *
 * Realistic exploit path (not merely theoretical): an agent scrapes an
 * untrusted page, passes a URL/param sourced from that page into a tool call,
 * the tool's error path echoes that string back (as scrape.ts, extract error
 * paths, and the resources/index.ts fix above all do) — the page's author now
 * controls a fake "agent_instruction:" line that lands in the calling agent's
 * context ahead of the genuine one.
 *
 * Fix: every pattern that used to test/replace `[\r\n]` (or a bare `\n`) now
 * uses this shared, named Unicode-aware line-terminator class instead of a
 * private ad-hoc regex — one definition, so a future newline-handling addition
 * to this file can reuse it correctly instead of re-introducing the ASCII-only
 * gap.
