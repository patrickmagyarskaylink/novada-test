diff-golden.py <baseline_dir> <after_dir>

Extraction of deploy-hosted.sh's inline Python heredoc — the "TWO-TIER VERDICT"
block inside PHASE 5 (VERIFY), originally ~lines 245-367 of that script — into a
standalone, independently runnable/testable module. This is a PORT, not a
redesign: the same two-tier verdict logic is preserved exactly —

    TIER 1 (HARD GATE): 7 deterministic, security/contract files —
    refused-set.json (firewall), toolslist-default/all/groups.json (tool
    contract), error-path.json, initialize.json (capabilities) are compared
    WHOLE-FILE (zero-diff required). redaction-probe.json is the seventh
    hard-gate file but is compared FIELD-SCOPED, not whole-file (see
    "redaction-probe.json field-scoped gate" below and _check_redaction_probe).

    TIER 2 (ADVISORY, printed not gated): dispatch-matrix.json per-tool shape —
    EXCEPT a tool's routing status crossing INTO or OUT OF a refused/unknown
    state (ROUTING_BAD_STATES), which escalates that specific finding to the
    hard-gate tier.

    redaction-probe.json field-scoped gate (fixed 2026-08-09, canary run
    31300731838): this file used to be compared whole-file like the other 6.
    Its `sample_markers` field records the section headings of the triggering
    error response (capture-golden.py section 7: `_section_headers(norm_p)[:5]
    or _top_keys(norm_p)[:5]` on the novada_proxy/novada_proxy_residential/
    novada_unblock probe response) — and those headings are
    ENTITLEMENT-DEPENDENT COPY, not a security signal: a provisioned account's
    novada_proxy error response includes an "as curl:" example section a bare
    CI account's response omits, so sample_markers legitimately differs by
    account tier and made the hard gate fail every night on cosmetic copy, not
    a real regression. The actual security invariant is `leaked` (must stay
    false) plus the probe's stable contract fields (triggered, trigger_tool,
    leak_checks' key set, note). Fix: redaction-probe.json is removed from
    HARD_GATE_FILES' whole-file loop and instead hard-gated field-by-field in
    _check_redaction_probe(); sample_markers is now printed advisory-only,
    exactly like dispatch-matrix.json's per-tool shape diff.

deploy-hosted.sh keeps its OWN inline copy of this logic for this pass (left
fully intact, byte-for-byte, on purpose). FOLLOW-UP, flagged not done here:
deploy-hosted.sh's VERIFY phase should be refactored to shell out to this
script (`python3 scripts/golden/diff-golden.py "$GOLDEN_BASELINE" "$GOLDEN_TMP"`)
instead of maintaining a second inline copy of the same verdict logic. Until
that follow-up lands, the two copies must be kept in sync by hand if the
verdict logic ever changes.

One deliberate, narrow behavior change from the heredoc, made during this
extraction (not a change to the two-tier *architecture* — only to missing-file
handling for the 7 hard-gate files):

    The original heredoc treats a hard-gate file MISSING FROM BASELINE as soft
    ("note but don't fail — baseline maintenance issue") regardless of whether
    after_dir has it. That was a reasonable default while baseline/ was still
    being built up incrementally. Today baseline/ is a frozen, checked-in
    artifact (see BASELINE.md — a specific captured version is pinned), so a
    hard-gate file missing from baseline_dir is itself a broken/corrupted
    baseline — a real regression in the regression net, not baseline
    maintenance noise. This script therefore FAILS LOUD (hard gate) in BOTH
    missing-file directions for the 7 HARD_GATE_FILES: baseline missing a file
    after_dir has, after_dir missing a file baseline has, or missing in both.
    dispatch-matrix.json (advisory tier) keeps the original asymmetric
    behavior: missing in baseline is a soft warning (advisory files never
    hard-gate on their own absence), missing in after_dir is still a hard fail
    (a fresh capture that omits a file it should always produce is a capture
    bug, not baseline drift).

Usage:
    python3 diff-golden.py <baseline_dir> <after_dir>

Exit codes:
    0  VERDICT: CLEAN        — no hard-gate failures (dispatch-matrix advisory
                               diff may still be non-empty; that's expected)
    1  VERDICT: NEEDS_REVIEW — one or more hard-gate failures, OR a usage/path
                               error (missing/invalid baseline_dir or after_dir)

# "timeout" added (NOV-854 hardening, 2026-07-19): capture-golden.py's dispatch
# exception handler (_run_dispatch, the try/except wrapping call_tool()) is the
# ONLY place dispatch-matrix.json's "status" field gets a value other than "ok"/
# "err" — see its `except Exception as e: return name, {"status": "timeout", ...}`
# branch. A mass paid-tool breakage from rate-limiting or wallet depletion (a
# malformed/non-JSON-RPC response that fails _parse_sse, or a hung request) lands
# a tool in this exact "timeout" state. Before this fix that crossing was invisible
# to the hard gate — dispatch-matrix.json is advisory-tier, so a swath of tools
# flipping ok -> timeout would only ever print in the human-glance advisory diff
# (VERDICT: CLEAN), never fail CI. Confirmed by reading capture-golden.py directly:
# no other status string ("refused"/"not_enabled"/"unknown"/"unknown_tool"/
# "no_handler") is ever actually written to dispatch-matrix.json today — those
# values are reserved for other routing-bad producers — so "timeout" is the one
# real gap this pass closes; the four pre-existing entries are left untouched.
